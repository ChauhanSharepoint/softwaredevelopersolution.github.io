                            Microsoft has given this SharePoint, which is a browser based document 
                            collaboration platform. It is an application framework, and it is an application 
                            as its own. It is a platform where user can share Data, Collaborate and people 
                            can also take this platform and customized platform as per their requirements.</span></p>

                            <strong>What are the advantages of SharePoint Portal Services (SPS) over SharePoint Team 
                            Services (STS)?</strong></p>

                            SharePoint Portal Services (SPS) has MUCH better document management. It has 
                            check-in, check-out, versioning, approval, publishing, subscriptions, 
                            categories, etc. STS does not have these features, or they are very scaled back. 
                            SharePoint Portal Services (SPS) has a better search engine, and can crawl 
                            multiple content sources. STS cannot. STS is easier to manage and much better 
                            for a team environment where there is not much Document Management going on. SPS 
                            is better for an organization, or where Document Management is crucial.</span></p>

                            CALM tands for Collaborative Application Markup Language and is an XML-based 
                            language that is used in Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services to define sites 
                            and lists, including, for example, fields, views, or forms, but CAML is also 
                            used to define tables in the Windows SharePoint Services database during site 
                            provisioning.</span></p>

                            You can create four different types of input forms including
                            1. An association form
                            2. An initiation form
                            3. A modification form
                            4. A task edits form.</span></p>

                            Two ways.
                            1. You can create your forms by using custom application pages, which are 
                            standard .aspx pages deployed to run out of the _layouts directory.
                            2. Using Microsoft Office InfoPath forms.</span></p>

                            only written for particular site &amp; solution is uploaded in the same site. The 
                            solution size limit is decided at the time of site creation &amp; if size increases 
                            or code showing bad performance then it is easy to administrator to stop the

                            <span>We can create sandbox solution for particular site but not for the entire

                            feature then we have to use properties.current.web beacuse there is no access of

                            2. default.master - this is used to support the 2007 user interface

                            4. simple.master- it is used for accessdenied.aspx, confirmation.aspx,

                            <strong>What is SharePoint Delegate Control?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                            
                            a. With the help of delegate control, we can take any OOB control of SharePoint 
                            and replace with our custom control without any modification in the SharePoint 
                            page. So that new custom control overrides the existing one.
                            
                            b. So the delegate control provides one of the options to add control (either 
                            server control or user control) on a SharePoint page.
                            
                            c. This is one of the important features of SharePoint, introduced in WSS v3 and 
                            so in MOSS 2007.
                            
                            d. For example : In master page SearchBox control is included as
                            
                            &lt;SharePoint:DelegateControl runat=&quot;server&quot; ControlId=&quot;SmallSearchInputBox&quot; /&gt;
                            
                            e. The above lines instantiate the delegate control object.
                            
                            f. This delegate control object uses features to locate the control which is 
                            specified in ControlId. So there must be the features (it includes feature at 
                            any scope) which creates and deploys the SmallSearchInputBox control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                            <span>1. Windows SharePoint Services (3.0) are free available with Windows 
                            Server. Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server (MOSS) 2007 is licensed version. WSS 
                            3.0 can be freely downloaded from Microsoft site.
                            
                            2. MOSS 2007 is based on WSS3.0 with some additional features like Enterprise 
                            Search, Business Data Catalog (BDC), User Profile, Excel Services, Single-Sign

                            1. To create or use site definition you need server admin access, but site 
                            template can install from web UI by site owners.
                            
                            2. Site definition supports feature stapling, but for site template additional 
                            features must be activated in gallery.
                            3. Site definitions are stored in hard disk, but site templates are stored in 
                            content DB.
                            4. Site definition can provision multiple webs, but site templates for single 
                            web only.
                            5. Creating site definition is relatively complex then site template creation.</span></p>

                            A content type is a WSS type definition which is flexible and reusable. It is 
                            used to define the columns and behavior for an item in a list or a document in a 
                            document library.
                            
                            For example, you can create a content type for a leave approval document with a 
                            unique set of columns, an event handler, and its own document template and 
                            attach it with document library/libraries.</span></p>

                            In Library you can create core document like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. But in

                            <strong>Mention some of the OOB features of SharePoint that aid with governance of an environment ?</strong></p>

                            Some of the OOB features of SharePoint that aid with governance of an 
                            environment are discussed as follows:
                            
                            1) Site templates – This feature is used for consistent branding, site 
                            structure, and layout which can enforce a set of customizations that are applied 
                            to a site definition.
                            2) Quotas – This will limits the amount of storage a site collection can use.
                            3) Locks - This feature will prevent users from either adding content to a site 
                            collection or using the site collection.
                            4) Web application permissions and policies – This feature is used for 
                            comprehensive security settings that apply to all users and groups for all site 
                            collections within a Web application.
                            5) Self-service site creation - This feature will enables the users to create 
                            their own site collections, thus must be incorporated into a governance scheme.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What are the monitoring features that are baked into SharePoint 2010 ?</strong></p>

                            The data about the state of the system is captured by the Diagnostic logging. 
                            The health and usage data collection uses specific timer jobs to perform 
                            monitoring tasks, collecting information about:
                            1) Performance Counter Fata
                            
                            2) Event Log Data
                            
                            3) Timer Service Data
                            
                            4) Metrics For Site Collections and Sites
                            
                            5) Search Usage Data</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>In comparision, which is faster - a WebPart or a User Control ?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                            
                            In comparision, a WebPart is faster than a User Control. A User Control in 
                            SharePoint is loaded by a webpart which adds an overhead. User Controls however, 
                            gives you an Interface to add controls and styles.</span></p>
