                            Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is an SDK for developing and deploying 
                            services on Windows. WCF provides a runtime environment for services, enabling 
                            you to expose CLR types as services, and to consume other services as CLR types.

                            WCF is flexible because its services can be hosted in different types of 
                            applications. The following lists several common scenarios for hosting WCF 
                            services:
                            <br />
                            IIS
                            <br />

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Web services can only be invoked by HTTP (traditional webservice with 
                            .asmx). While WCF Service or a WCF component can be invoked by any protocol 
                            (like http, tcp etc.) and any transport type.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Second web services are not flexible. However, WCF Services are flexible. If you 
                            make a new version of the service then you need to just expose a new end. 
                            Therefore, services are agile and which is a very practical approach looking at 
                            the current business trends.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We develop WCF as contracts, interface, operations, and data contracts. As the 
                            developer we are more focused on the business logic services and need not worry 
                            about channel stack. WCF is a unified programming API for any kind of services 
                            so we create the service and use configuration information to set up the 
                            communication mechanism like HTTP/TCP/MSMQ etc </span>

                            contract, but also has additional methods for managing the proxy life cycle and 
                            the connection to the service. The proxy completely encapsulates every aspect of 
                            the service: its location, its implementation technology and runtime platform, 
                            and the communication transport.
