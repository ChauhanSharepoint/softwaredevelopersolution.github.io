                                do the best possible job. The appropriate way to deal with stress is to make 
                                sure I have the correct balance between good stress and bad stress. I need good 
                                stress to stay motivated and productive.</span></li>

                            <span>Skills and experience are at the top of the list of key factors that 
                            employers look for when interviewing potential employees. Think about the most 
                            important skills you possess and how they will help you in a particular position 
                            or field. During the interview, offer specific examples to illustrate your 
                            point. Don&#39;t cross the line of confidence by sounding too pompous or arrogant. 
                            Employers will never believe you saved the world from mass destruction. They 
                            will, however, believe you increased departmental sales by 25 percent.</span></p>

                            systems analyst, I&#39;ve developed a number of important skills including business 
                            modeling, process re-engineering, software-package evaluation, and advanced 
                            programming capabilities in UNIX and C environments. I was very pleased to 
                            discover that these are the skills you are seeking. Would you like to hear about 
                            specific examples of my work?</span></p>

                            between your current or previous job and the job you&#39;re interviewing for. Don&#39;t 
                            be afraid to ask a question in your answer. However, the last thing you want to 
                            do is seem garrulous, so find out if the interviewer would like to hear specific 
                            examples, and if so, oblige her</span></i><span>.</span></p>

                            <span>“I wear many hats” is one of the clichés in the job market to be avoided 
                            in interviews. Other clichés to be avoided are, “I am a people person,” “I am a 
                            jack of all trades,” “I am interested in honing my skills,” and “I am a

                            <b><span>YES:</span></b><span> Once I&#39;m given a job or a project, I tackle it 
                            with unrelenting energy. I want to learn everything I can, and my goal is to 
                            achieve results beyond the expectations of my supervisor. I really strive to 
                            excel in all I do.</span></p>

                            <i><span>Your answer should demonstrate confidence in your abilities without 
                            sounding conceited. A good way to illustrate your worth as an employee is to 
                            talk about what others, preferably past and present supervisors, would say about 
                            you. If you have specific skills that relate to the job, be sure to emphasize 
                            this point as well. Make sure that the reasons you give for your uniqueness are 
                            well thought out. Citing your own experience in the field—unless it is unique or 
                            a special skill in high demand—is pointless, as many of the other applicants are 
                            probably experienced as well</span></i><span>.</span></p>

                            <b><span>YES:</span></b><span> I would say that my strong interpersonal skills 
                            are one of my greatest strengths; I work easily with others and am always open 
                            to various points of view. I also have good judgment about people and an 
                            intuitive sense of their talents and their ability to contribute to a given 
                            problem. Given the type of employee you are looking for, I think that these 
                            skills directly relate to the job. I am extremely hardworking. In addition to 
                            maintaining an active membership in various professional societies, I have spent 
                            the past two years taking evening classes to further my education and knowledge 
                            of this industry.</span></p>

                            loyal”). For each strength you give, be prepared to back it up. To say that you 
                            have initiative without mentioning a specific example of this trait will not 
                            work. In addition to describing how your strengths have worked for you in the 
                            past, talk about the ways in which these skills could be put to use in the new

                            <b><span>YES:</span></b><span> On some occasions, it has taken me longer to 
                            complete a project than I had originally anticipated. I consider myself a bit of 
                            a perfectionist; I refuse to turn a project in if it is not the best it could 
                            be. While this serves me well in some respects, it can also set me behind 
                            schedule sometimes. For the past month, I have been taking a time-management 
                            class once a week. Already, I can see that the skills I&#39;m learning are helping 
                            with this tendency to dwell on certain projects.</span></p>

                            yourself in the foot. Think about the many duties the job entails, and try not 
                            to point out a weakness that would be a major obstacle as far as your potential 
                            duties are concerned. Try to think of a weakness that is not too big of a deal 
                            and can be overcome. Another smart move is to discuss how you are working to 
                            strengthen this weakness</span></i><span>.</span></p>

                            details, figures, and facts. If the interviewer thinks you haven&#39;t done your

                            <b><span>YES:</span></b><span> In my current job, I&#39;ve recently completed three 
                            re-engineering projects. I gathered all the necessary market data, developed a 
                            benchmarking program, and put together a team to do the evaluation and analysis. 
                            As a result, I&#39;m ready to tackle the major re-engineering project that you&#39;ve 
                            listed as the priority of this job during the first year. In my past job, I was

                            in the testing of a new turbo engine. This experience will also help me tackle 
                            this job, which involves a close and careful working relationship between your 
                            technical group and your field-testing group.</span></p>

                            Draw parallels from your current or previous job to the requirements of this 
                            job. With first interviews especially, the interviewer may very well be a human 
                            resources professional, not someone associated with your job or industry. She 
                            may not know much about the field to which you are applying. A similarity that 
                            seems obvious to you may not be so obvious to the recruiter. By showcasing your 
                            own knowledge, you are demonstrating that you are a knowledgeable employee. Even 
                            if you are new to the professional job market, have only held a part-time job, 
                            or have never held a job, you have done things in your life that you can count

                            marketing plans is what will keep me ahead of the competition. Creativity is 
                            also of major importance to the marketing industry; new ideas can quickly become 
                            stale and stagnant. A successful marketing associate will always be looking 
                            ahead to the next big revolution. If, just a few years ago, I had not been aware 
                            of the important role that social media would play in our day-to-day duties, my 
                            current company could have been quickly overtaken by the competition.</span></p>

                            prerequisites to developing the skills you mention. For example, you wouldn&#39;t

                            organizing, problem solving, writing, listening, and communicating. Personal 
                            skills tell an employer how well your personality will fit in with those around

                            or not you are able to assert authority, and how well you manage your time. 
                            Technical skills, such as your computer knowledge and customer service skills, 
                            are important as well</span></i><span>.</span></p>

                            <b><span>YES:</span></b><span> In this age of technology, human contact is 
                            highly underrated. I know how frustrated I get when I call a company and am met 
                            with a barrage of computer voices telling me which number to hit and whom to 
                            call. In business, I never assume that a customer is satisfied until she has 
                            told me so directly. I take a very personal approach to following up with every 
                            customer. The feedback that I have received—both positive and negative—has 
                            provided valuable insight into the quality and characteristics of our products. 
                            What augments my past successes even more is how much the customer appreciates 
                            these follow-ups, especially when there&#39;s been some sort of problem and I still 
                            have the opportunity to correct it on a timely basis. And the customer feedback 
                            doesn&#39;t just benefit me; I&#39;m always passing on customer comments to our 
                            production and design teams so that we can ensure we are making the best 
                            possible product.</span></p>

                            mention that little bit extra that you do. Talk about observations other people 
                            have made about your strengths or talents. This question is similar to the

                            she expecting you to retrace all of your achievements? It is not wrong to ask 
                            the interviewer this question if you&#39;re really unsure of how detailed an answer

                            assignment was to develop, write, and continually rewrite a business plan. I
