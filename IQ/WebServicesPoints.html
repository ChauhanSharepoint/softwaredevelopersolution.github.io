                            can change it to distinguish this overloaded method

                            implementation from others. When specifying the method name, the resulting SOAP 
                            messages will reflect this name instead of an actual method name.</span></p>

                        <p>
                            <span>First, let&#39;s start off by creating a very simple webservice.
                            <br />
                            Creating A Webservice
                            <br />
                            1.Create a folder named Webservice under wwwroot
                            <br />
                            2. Create a File
                            <br />
                            &lt;%@ WebService Language=&quot;c#&quot; Class=&quot;AddNumbers&quot;%&gt;
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            using System;
                            <br />
                            using System.Web.Services;
                            <br />
                            public class AddNumbers : WebService
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            int sum;
                            <br />
                            sum = a + b;
                            <br />
                            return sum;
                            <br />
                            }
                            <br />
                            }
                            <br />
                            3.Save this file as AddService.asmx [asmx-&gt; file extension]
                            <br />
                            4.Now the webservice is created and ready for the clients to use it.
                            <br />
                            5. Now we can call this webservice using
                            <br />
                            http://ip address/Webservice/Addservice.asmx/Add?a=10&amp;b=5
                            <br />
                            This will return the result in XML format
                            <br />
                            Deploying the Webservice in the Client Machine

                            1.At the command prompt:

                            -This will create a file called FileNmame.cs .
                            <br />

                            the webservice.
                            <br />
                            2.Compilation

                            This will create a dll with the name of the public class of the asmx file.( In 
                            our case, it is &quot;AddNumbers.dll&quot; )

                            message, Channel converts message into appropriate format like XML or binary 
                            format. The channel that carries message(Mashalled parameter) can use protocal 
                            like TCP and HTTP. Channel can be HTTPChannel and TCPChannel. The HTTPChannel 
                            use soapFormatter to serialize messages into the XML format using SOAP protocal. 
                            Using SOAP method allows the client to call method on the remote object that 
                            might not be using .Net framework. The TCPChannel use binaryFormatter to

                            <span>W3C, in the XML specification, has defined certain rules that need to be 
                            followed while creating XML documents. The examples of such rules include: 
                            having exactly one root element, having end-tag for each start- tag, using 
                            single/double quotes for attribute values, and so on. If an XML document follows 
                            all these rules, it is said to be well-formed document and XML parsers can be 
                            used to parse and process such documents.
                            <br />
                            Document Type Definitions (DTDs) or XML Schemas can be used to define the 
                            structure and content of a specific class of XML documents. This includes the 
                            parent-child relationship details, attribute lists, data type information, value 
                            restrictions, etc. In addition to the well-formedness rules, if an XML document 
                            also follows the rules specified in the associated DTD/Schema, it is said to be 
                            a valid XML document. All valid XML documents are well-formed; but the reverse 
                            is not always true, that is, well-formed XML documents do not necessarily have 
                            to be valid.</span></p>
