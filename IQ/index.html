							<h1>Learn <strong>Interview Questions</strong></h1>
						</header>
						<p>
                            Most interview questions are innocuous: They’re meant to evaluate whether you’re right for the job, and whether this company could be the next and best place for you.
                            But some of the questions you’re asked, experts tell us, have a slightly more nefarious purpose: They are meant to trip you up by confusing you, catching you in a fib, or showing you’re unprepared.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But you don’t have to be tripped up by these tricky questions. The best ways to answer them, according to experts.
                        </p>

					    <h3>1. Screening Interview</h3>
					    <blockquote>
                        Screening is commonly the first step in recruitment process of the company after application forms have been received. Its purpose is to assess generally the skills and qualification of potential candidates and select out those who lack necessary qualification or cannot meet job requirements. Only those candidates who have adequately met job requirements or have certain talents may pass this interview phase. This interview is normally short and the candidates are supposed to prove themselves in the briefest manner to qualify for the job.
                        </blockquote>

					    <blockquote>

                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>7. Behavioral Interview</h3>

                        </br>
                        STAR is short for a procedure, in which:</br>
                        • S = Situation: describe the situation.</br>
                        • T = Task: identify the goals you wish to achieve.</br>
                        • A = Action: determine the action you should perform to reach such goals.</br>

					    <blockquote>
                        In a One-on-One interview, you will participate directly in an interview with one interviewer (normally who shall determine you are qualified or not). You will come to this round after passing a panel or group interview… and your abilities and skills have been proved qualifying. And now, you have to face with one interviewer who will ask you very specific about the job and yourself. To survive this interview, not only you need to demonstrate your abilities and skills again but also you have to know how to develop a friendly relation with the interviewer.

					    <blockquote>
                        In some cases, the number of applicants in a job may reach thousands which means recruitment process has such a hard job to do. In such cases, there may be a lot of “Screening” interviews to reduce the number of candidates and you will have to pass these follow-up interviews to be a potential candidate. There may be different interviewers as well. Remember that patience plays a crucial role in these interviews.
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>11. Final Selection Interview</h3>
					    <blockquote>
                        There is always a final decision-maker during a recruitment process who will decide if you are employed or not. Normally, in the third interview phase, you will be met with this person. He or she shall personally interview you with very strict questions. Only a few can manage to this final interview with this person. Pass this and you get the job. Lose it, you may lose the job, too; however, you will still be in the list of potential candidates. Patience, Politeness, Professional and Friendliness are the keys to succeed in this phase. The employer may ask other people about you, even the receptionist any each member of the interview panel. Just keep your head cool facing this VIP and you will get your desired job.
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>12. Informational Interview</h3>
					    <blockquote>
                        This type of interview is more like a meeting between a candidate and the interviewer to provide more information about the job and the company to the candidate. Job-seekers shall be the ones who “interview” the employers and the employers shall provide information about the job as asked. The candidates may present their skills and qualifications to the employers and ask if those are qualified for the job while the employers may note down anyone whose qualification is remarkable.
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>13. Structured Interview</h3>
					    <blockquote>
                        Normally, Screening Interview is combined with another technique which is called structured interview. Due to time limits, in structure interview, copies of a questionnaire shall be given to all the applicants and require them to fill in. Questions may be about specific duties of the job, information about the company or the industry. Nevertheless, the answer shall then be recollected and compared with others to select out those most outstanding.
