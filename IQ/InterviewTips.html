							<h3>Top 20 Interview Questions and Answers:</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
                            <span>Review these typical interview questions and try to make a strategy as how 
                            you would answer them. Read the questions listed. You would get some strategic 
                            suggestions with them.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>1. Define yourself:</span></b><span>
                            <br />
                            It is the most common question in interviews. You need to have a short statement 
                            prepared in your mind. Be careful that it does not sound rehearsed. Limit it to 
                            work-related items unless instructed otherwise. Talk about things you have done 
                            and jobs you have held that relate to the position you are interviewing for. 
                            Start with the item farthest back and work up to the present.
</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>2. Why did you leave your last job?</span></b><span>
                            <br />
                            Stay positive regardless of the circumstances. Never refer to a major problem 
                            with management and never speak ill of supervisors, co- workers or the 
                            organization. If you do, you will be the one looking bad. Keep smiling and talk 
                            about leaving for a positive reason such as an opportunity, a chance to do 
                            something special or other forward- looking reasons. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>3. What experience do you have in this field?</span></b><span>
                            <br />
                            Speak about specifics that relate to the position you are applying for. If you 
                            do not have specific experience, get as close as you can.<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>4. Do you consider yourself successful?<br />
                            </b>You should always answer yes and briefly explain why. A good explanation is 
                            that you have set goals, and you have met some and are on track to achieve the 
                            others.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>5. What do co-workers say about you?<br />
                            </span></b><span>Be prepared with a quote or two from co-workers. Either a 
                            specific statement or a paraphrase will work. Jill Clark, a co-worker at Smith 
                            Company, always said I was the hardest workers she had ever known. It is as 
                            powerful as Jill having said it at the interview herself.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>6. What do you know about this organization?<br />
                            </span></b><span>This question is one reason to do some research on the 
                            organization before the interview. Find out where they have been and where they 
                            are going. What are the current issues and who are the major players? 
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>7. What have you done to improve your knowledge in the last year?<br />
                            </span></b><span>Try to include improvement activities that relate to the job. A 
                            wide variety of activities can be mentioned as positive self-improvement. Have 
                            some good ones handy to mention. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>8. Are you applying for other jobs?<br />
                            </span></b><span>Be honest but do not spend a lot of time in this area. Keep the 
                            focus on this job and what you can do for this organization. Anything else is a 
                            distraction.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>9. Why do you want to work for this organization?<br />
                            </span></b><span>This may take some thought and certainly, should be based on 
                            the research you have done on the organization. Sincerity is extremely important 
                            here and will easily be sensed. Relate it to your long-term career goals. 
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>10. Do you know anyone who works for us?<br />
                            </span></b><span>Be aware of the policy on relatives working for the 
                            organization. This can affect your answer even though they asked about friends 
                            not relatives. Be careful to mention a friend only if they are well thought of.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>11. What kind of salary do you need?</span></b><span><br />
                            A loaded question. A nasty little game that you will probably lose if you answer 
                            first. So, do not answer it. Instead, say something like, That&#39;s a tough 
                            question. Can you tell me the range for this position? In most cases, the 
                            interviewer, taken off guard, will tell you. If not, say that it can depend on 
                            the details of the job. Then give a wide range.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>12. Are you a team player?</span></b><span><br />
                            You are, of course, a team player. Be sure to have examples ready. Specifics 
                            that show you often perform for the good of the team rather than for yourself 
                            are good evidence of your team attitude. Do not brag, just say it in a 
                            matter-of-fact tone. This is a key point. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>13. How long would you expect to work for us if hired?</span></b><span><br />
                            Specifics here are not good. Something like this should work: I&#39;d like it to be 
                            a long time. Or As long as we both feel I&#39;m doing a good job.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>14. Have you ever had to fire anyone? How did you feel about that?<br />
                            </span></b><span>This is serious. Do not make light of it or in any way seem 
                            like you like to fire people. At the same time, you will do it when it is the 
                            right thing to do. When it comes to the organization versus the individual who 
                            has created a harmful situation, you will protect the organization. Remember 
                            firing is not the same as layoff or reduction in force.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>15. What is your philosophy towards work?<br />
                            </b>The interviewer is not looking for a long or flowery dissertation here. Do 
                            you have strong feelings that the job gets done? Yes. That&#39;s the type of answer 
                            that works best here. Short and positive, showing a benefit to the organization. 
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>16. If you had enough money to retire right now, would you?<br />
                            </span></b><span>Answer yes if you would. But since you need to work, this is 
                            the type of work you prefer. Do not say yes if you do not mean it.<b> </b>
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>17. Have you ever been asked to leave a position?<br />
                            </span></b><span>If you have not, say no. If you have, be honest, brief and 
                            avoid saying negative things about the people or organization involved.<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>18. Explain how you would be an asset to this organization.<br />
                            </b>You should be anxious for this question. It gives you a chance to highlight 
                            your best points as they relate to the position being discussed. Give a little 
                            advance thought to this. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span>19. Why should we hire you?<br />
                            </span></b><span>Point out how your assets meet what the organization needs. Do 
                            not mention any other candidates to make a comparison.<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>20. Tell me about a suggestion you have made.<br />
                            </b>Have a good one ready. Be sure and use a suggestion that was accepted and 
                            was then considered successful. One related to the type of work applied for is a 
                            real plus.</span></p>
