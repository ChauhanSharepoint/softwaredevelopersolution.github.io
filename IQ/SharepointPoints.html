                            The pages in a Web site generally cover one or more topics and are 
                            interconnected through hyperlinks. Most Web sites have a home page as their 
                            starting point. While a Web is simply a blank site with SharePoint functionality 
                            built in; meaning you have to create the site from the ground up.</p>

                            intranet, extranet, and Internet applications across the enterprise.<br />
                            * Business users gain greater control over the storage, security, distribution, 
                            and management of their electronic content, with tools that are easy to use and 
                            tightly integrated into familiar, everyday applications.
                            <br />
                            * Organizations can accelerate shared business processes with customers and 
                            partners across organizational boundaries using InfoPath Forms Services–driven 
                            solutions.
                            <br />
                            * Information workers can find information and people efficiently and easily 
                            through the facilitated information-sharing functionality and simplified content 
                            publishing. In addition, access to back-end data is achieved easily through a 
                            browser, and views into this data can be personalized.
                            <br />
                            * Administrators have powerful tools at their fingertips that ease deployment, 
                            management, and system administration, so they can spend more time on strategic 
                            tasks.
                            <br />
                            * Developers have a rich platform to build a new class of applications, called 
                            Office Business Applications, that combine powerful developer functionality with 
                            the flexibility and ease of deployment of Office SharePoint Server 2007. Through 
                            the use of out-of-the-box application services, developers can build richer 
                            applications with less code.

                            sites and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007?</p>
                        <p>
                             Microsoft Office 
                            SharePoint Server 2007 for Internet sites and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 
                            2007 have identical feature functionality. While the feature functionality is 
                            similar, the usage rights are different.

                            If you are creating an 
                            Internet, or Extranet, facing website, it is recommended that you use Microsoft 
                            Office SharePoint Server <span>2007 for Internet sites</span> which does not 
                            require the purchase client access licenses. Websites hosted using an “Internet 
                            sites” edition can only be used for Internet facing websites and all content, 
                            information, and applications must be accessible to non-employees. Websites 
                            hosted using an “Internet sites” edition cannot be accessed by employees

                        <p>
                            Office Outlook 2007 
                            provides bidirectional offline synchronization with SharePoint document 
                            libraries, discussion groups, contacts, calendars, and tasks.

                            Groove 2007, included as part of Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007, will enable 
                            bidirectional offline synchronization with SharePoint document libraries.

                            document panel and the ability to publish to Excel Services will only be enabled 
                            when using Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2007or Office Enterprise 2007.

                            How do I invite users to join a Windows SharePoint Services Site? Is the site 
                            secure?</p>
                        <p>
                            SharePoint-based Web 
                            sites can be password-protected to restrict access to registered users, who are 
                            invited to join via e-mail. In addition, the site administrator can restrict 
                            certain members&#39; roles by assigning different permission levels to view post and 
                            edit.</p>
                        <p>
                            Can I post any kind of document?</p>
                        <p>
                            You can post documents 
                            in many formats, including .pdf, .htm and .doc. In addition, if you are using 
                            Microsoft Office XP, you can save documents directly to your Windows SharePoint 
                            Services site.</p>
                        <p>
                            Can I download information directly from a SharePoint site to a personal digital 
                            assistant (PDA)?</p>
                        <p>
                            No you cannot. 
                            However, you can exchange contact information lists with Microsoft Outlook.</p>
                        <p>
                            How 
                            long does it take to set up the initial team Web site?</p>
                        <p>
                             It only takes a few 
                            minutes to create a complete Web site. Preformatted forms let you and your team 
                            members contribute to the site by filling out lists. Standard forms include 
                            announcements, events, contacts, tasks, surveys, discussions and links.</p>
                        <p>
                             Can 
                            I create custom templates?</p>
                        <p>
                             Yes you can. You can 
                            have templates for business plans, doctor&#39;s office, lawyer&#39;s office etc.</p>
                        <p>
                             How 
                            can I make my site public? By default, all sites are created private.</p>
                        <p>
                             If you want your site 
                            to be a public Web site, enable anonymous access for the entire site. Then you 
                            can give out your URL to anybody in your business card, e-mail or any other 
                            marketing material. The URL for your Web site will be:<br />
                            http:// yoursitename.wss.bcentral.com</p>
                        <p>
                             Hence, please take 
                            special care to name your site.<br />
                            These Web sites are ideal for information and knowledge intensive sites and/or 
                            sites where you need to have shared Web workspace.<br />
                            Remember: Under each parent Web site, you can create up to 10 sub-sites each 
                            with unique permissions, settings and security rights.</p>
                        <p>
                             How 
                            do the sub sites work?</p>
                        <p>
                             You can create a sub 
                            site for various categories. For example:<br />
                            * Departments - finance, marketing, IT<br />
                            * Products - electrical, mechanical, hydraulics
                            <br />
                            * Projects - Trey Research, Department of Transportation, FDA<br />
                            * Team - Retention team, BPR team<br />
                            * Clients - new clients, old clients<br />
                            * Suppliers - Supplier 1, Supplier 2, Supplier 3<br />
                            * Customers - Customer A, Customer B, Customer C<br />
                            * Real estate - property A, property B</p>
                         
                        <p>
                             You can keep track of 
                            permissions for each team separately so that access is restricted while 
                            maintaining global access to the parent site.</p>
                        <p>
                             How 
                            do I make my site non-restricted?</p>
                        <p>
                             If you want your site 
                            to have anonymous access enabled (i.e., you want to treat it like any site on 
                            the Internet that does not ask you to provide a user name and password to see 
                            the content of the site), follow these simple steps:<br />
                            # Login as an administrator<br />
                            # Click on site settings<br />
                            # Click on Go to Site Administration<br />
                            # Click on Manage anonymous access<br />
                            # Choose one of the three conditions on what Anonymous users can access:<br />
                            ** Entire Web site<br />
                            ** Lists and libraries<br />
                            ** Nothing</p>
                        <p>
                             Default condition is 
                            nothing; your site has restricted access. The default conditions allow you to 
                            create a secure site for your Web site.</p>
                        <p>
                             Can 
                            I get domain name for my Web site?</p>
                        <p>
                             Unfortunately, no. At 
                            this point, we don&#39;t offer domain names for SharePoint sites. But very soon we 
                            will be making this available for all our SharePoint site customers. Please keep 
                            checking this page for further update on this. Meanwhile, we suggest you go 
                            ahead and set up your site and create content for it.</p>
                        <p>
                             What 
                            are picture libraries?</p>
                        <p>
                             Picture libraries 
                            allow you to access a photo album and view it as a slide show or thumbnails or a 
                            film strip. You can have separate folder for each event, category, etc</p>
                        <p>
                             What 
                            are the advantages of a hosted SharePoint vs. one that is on an in-house server?</p>
                        <p>
                             * No hardware 
                            investment, i.e. lower costs
                            <br />
                            * No software to download - ready to start from the word go<br />
                            * No IT resources - Anyone who has used a Web program like Hotmail can use it<br />
                            * Faster deployment</p>
                        <p>
                             Can 
                            I ask users outside of my organization to participate in my Windows SharePoint 
                            Services site?</p>
                        <p>
                             Yes. You can manage 
                            this process using the Administration Site Settings. Simply add users via their 
                            e-mail alias and assign permissions such as Reader or Contributor.</p>
                        <p>
                             Are 
                            there any IT requirements or downloads required to set up my SharePoint site?</p>
                        <p>
                             No. You do not need to 
                            download any code or plan for any IT support. Simply complete the on-line signup 
                            process and provide us your current and correct email address. Once you have 
                            successfully signed up and your site has been provisioned, we will send a 
                            confirmation to the email address you provided.</p>
                        <p>
                             I am 
                            located outside of the United States. Are there any restrictions or requirements 
                            for accessing the Windows SharePoint Services?</p>
                        <p>
                             No. There are no 
                            system or bandwidth limitations for international trial users. Additionally 
                            language packs have been installed which allow users to set up sub-webs in 
                            languages other than English. These include: Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, 
                            French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), 
                            Spanish and Swedish.</p>
                        <p>
                             Are 
                            there any browser recommendations?</p>
                        <p>
                             Yes. Microsoft 
                            recommends using the following browsers for viewing and editing Windows 
                            SharePoint Services sites: Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 with Service Pack 2, 
                            Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 with Service Pack 2, Internet Explorer 6, 
                            Netscape Navigator 6.2 or later.</p>
                        <p>
                             What 
                            security levels are assigned to users?</p>
                        <p>
                            Security levels are 
                            assigned by the administrator who is adding the user. There are four levels by 
                            default and additional levels can be composed as necessary.<br />
                            * Reader - Has read-only access to the Web site.<br />
                            * Contributor - Can add content to existing document libraries and lists.<br />
                            * Web Designer - Can create lists and document libraries and customize pages in 
                            the Web site.<br />
                            * Administrator - Has full control of the Web site.</p>

                            How 
                            secure are Windows SharePoint Services sites hosted by Microsoft?</p>

                            team tests and deploys software updates in order to maintain the highest level 
                            of security and software reliability. Software hot-fixes and service packs are 
                            tested and deployed based on their priority and level of risk. Security related 
                            hot-fixes are rapidly deployed into the environment to address current threats. 
                            A comprehensive software validation activity ensures software stability through 
                            regression testing prior to deployment.</p>

                            What 
                            is the difference between an Internet and an intranet site?</p>
                        <p>
                            An internet site is a 
                            normal site that anyone on the internet can access . You can set up a site for your company that can be 
                            accessed by anyone without any user name and password.</p>
                        <p>
                            An intranet (or 
                            internal network), though hosted on the Web, can only be accessed by people who 
                            are members of the network. They need to have a login and password that was 
                            assigned to them when they were added to the site by the site administrator.</p>

                            What 
                            is a workspace?</p>
                        <p>
                            A site or workspace is 
                            when you want a new place for collaborating on Web pages, lists and document 
                            libraries. For example, you might create a site to manage a new team or project, 
                            collaborate on a document or prepare for a meeting.</p>
                        <p>
                             What 
                            are the various kinds of roles the users can have?</p>
                        <p>
                            A user can be assigned 
                            one of the following roles<br />
                            * Reader - Has read-only access to the Web site.<br />
                            * Contributor - Can add content to existing document libraries and lists.<br />
                            * Web Designer - Can create lists and document libraries and customize pages in 
                            the Web site.<br />
                            * Administrator - Has full control of the Web site.</p>
                        <p>
                             Can 
                            more than one person use the same login?</p>
                        <p>
                            If the users sharing 
                            that login will have the same permissions and there is no fear of them sharing a 
                            password, then yes. Otherwise, this is discouraged.</p>
                        <p>
                             >How 
                            customizable is the user-to-user access?</p>
                        <p>
                            User permissions apply 
                            to an entire Web, not to documents themselves. However, you can have additional 
                            sub webs that can optionally have their own permissions. Each user can be given 
                            any of four default roles. Additional roles can be defined by the administrator.</p>
                        <p>
                             Can 
                            each user have access to their own calendar?</p>
                        <p>
                            Yes there are two ways 
                            to do this,<br />
                            * by creating a calendar for each user, or<br />
                            * by creating a calendar with a view for each user</p>

                             How 
                            many files can I upload?</p>
                        <p>
                            There is no 
                            restriction in place except that any storage consumed beyond that provided by 
                            the base offering may have an additional monthly charge associated with them.</p>
                        <p>
                             What 
                            types of files can I upload / post to the site?</p>
                        <p>
                            The only files 
                            restricted are those ending with the following extensions: .asa, .asp, .ida, 
                            .idc, .idq.&nbsp; Microsoft reserves the right to add additional file types to 
                            this listing at any time.&nbsp; Also, no content that violates the terms of 
                            service may be uploaded or posted to the site.</p>
                        <p>
                             Can 
                            SharePoint be linked to an external data source?</p>
                        <p>
                            SharePoint data can be 
                            opened with Access and Excel as an external data source. Thus, SharePoint can be 
                            referenced as an external data source. SharePoint itself cannot reference an 
                            external data source.</p>
                        <p>
                             Can 
                            SharePoint be linked to a SQL database?</p>
                        <p>
                            This is possible via a 
                            custom application, but it not natively supported by SharePoint or SQL Server.</p>
                        <p>
                             Can 
                            I customize my Windows SharePoint Services site?</p>
                        <p>
                            YES! Windows 
                            SharePoint Services makes updating sites and their content from the browser 
                            easier then ever.</p>
                        <p>
                            SharePoint includes 
                            tools that let you create custom lists, calendars, page views, etc. You can 
                            apply a theme; add List, Survey and Document Library Web Parts to a page; create 
                            personal views; change logos; connect Web Parts and more.</p>
                        <p>
                            To fully customize 
                            your site, you can use Microsoft FrontPage 2003. Specifically, you can use 
                            FrontPage themes and shared borders, and also use FrontPage to create photo 
                            galleries and top ten lists, utilize standard usage reports, and integrate 
                            automatic Web content.</p>

                            document processing, Web content management and publishing, records management, 
                            policy management, and support for multilingual publishing.

                             Will 
                            SharePoint Portal Server and Team Services ever merge?</p>
                        <p>
                            The products will come 
                            together because they are both developed by the Office team.

                             What 
                            does partial trust mean the Web Part developer?</p>
                        <p>
                            If an assembly is 
                            installed into the BIN directory, the code must be ensured that provides error 
                            handling in the event that required permissions are not available. Otherwise, 
                            unhandled security exceptions may cause the Web Part to fail and may affect page 
                            rendering on the page where the Web Part appears.</p>
                        <p>
                             How 
                            can I raise the trust level for assemblies installed in the BIN directory?</p>
                        <p>
                            Windows SharePoint 
                            Services can use any of the following three options from ASP.NET and the CLR to 
                            provide assemblies installed in the BIN directory with sufficient permissions. 
                            The following table outlines the implications and requirements for each option.</p>
                        <p>
                            Option&nbsp;Pros&nbsp;Cons</p>
                        <p>
                            Increase the trust 
                            level for the entire virtual server. For more information, see &quot;Setting the 
                            trust level for a virtual server&quot;&nbsp;Easy to implement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a development 
                            environment, increasing the trust level allows you to test an assembly with 
                            increased permissions while allowing you to recompile assemblies directly into 
                            the BIN directory without resetting IIS.&nbsp;This option is least secure.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This option affects 
                            all assemblies used by the virtual server.<br />
                            There is no guarantee the destination server has the required trust level. 
                            Therefore, Web Parts may not work once installed on the destination server.</p>
                        <p>
                            Create a custom policy 
                            file for your assemblies. For more information, see &quot;How do I create a custom 
                            policy file?&quot;&nbsp;Recommended approach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This option is most 
                            secure.</p>
                        <p>
                            An assembly can 
                            operate with a unique policy that meets the minimum permission requirements for 
                            the assembly.</p>
                        <p>
                            By creating a custom 
                            security policy, you can ensure the destination server can run your Web Parts.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>
                            Requires the most 
                            configuration of all three options.<br />
                            Install your assemblies in the GAC&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>
                            Easy to implement.
                            <br />
                            This grants Full trust to your assembly without affecting the trust level of 
                            assemblies installed in the BIN directory.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>
                            This option is less 
                            secure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Assemblies installed 
                            in the GAC are available to all virtual servers and applications on a server 
                            running Windows SharePoint Services. This could represent a potential security 
                            risk as it potentially grants a higher level of permission to your assembly 
                            across a larger scope than necessary</p>
                        <p>
                            In a development 
                            environment, you must reset IIS every time you recompile assemblies.</p>
                        <p>
                            Licensing issues may 
                            arise due to the global availability of your assembly.</p>

                             Does 
                            SharePoint work with NFS?</p>
                        <p>
                            Yes and no. It can 
                            crawl documents on an NFS volume, but the sharepoint database or logs cannot be 
                            stored there.</p>
                        <p>
                             How 
                            is SharePoint Portal Server different from the Site Server?</p>
                        <p>
                            Site Server has search 
                            capabilities but these are more advanced using SharePoint. SPS uses digital 
                            dashboard technology which
                            <br />
                            provides a nice interface for creating web parts and showing them on dashboards 
                            (pages). SS doesn&#39;t have anything as advanced as that. The biggest difference 
                            would be SPS document management features which also integrate with web folders 
                            and MS Office.</p>

                             Why 
                            Sharepoint is not a viable solution for enterprise wide deployments?</p>
                        <p>
                            Document management 
                            does not scale beyond a single server, but scales great within a single server. 
                            For example, a quad Xeon machine with 4GB of RAM works great for a document 
                            management server that has about 900,000 - 1,000,000 document, but if you need 
                            to store 50,000,000 document and want to have them all in one single workspace 
                            then it does not scale at all. If you need a scenario like this, you need to 
                            plan your deployment right and it should scale for you, it just does not right 
                            out of the box.
                            <br />
                            If you are using your server as a portal and search server most for the most 
                            part it scales great. You can have many different servers crawl content sources 
                            and have separate servers searching and serving the content. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have &lt; 750,000 
                            documents per server and fewer than 4 content sources and fewer than 50,000 
                            users, SPS should scale just fine for your needs with the proper planning.</p>
                        <p>
                             What 
                            are the actual advantages of SharePoint Portal Services (SPS) over SharePoint 
                            Team Services (STS)?</p>
                        <p>
                            SharePoint Portal 
                            Services (SPS) has MUCH better document management. It has check-in, check-out, 
                            versioning, approval, publishing, subscriptions, categories, etc. STS does not 
                            have these features, or they are very scaled back. SharePoint team Services 
                            (SPS) has a better search engine, and can crawl multiple content sources. STS 
                            cannot. STS is easier to manage and much better for a team environment where 
                            there is not much Document Management going on. SPS is better for an 
                            organization, or where Document Management is crucial.</p>

                             How 
                            Does SharePoint work?</p>
                        <p>
                            The browser sends a 
                            DAV packet to IIS asking to perform a document check in. PKMDASL.DLL, an ISAPI 
                            DLL, parses the packet and sees that it has the proprietary INVOKE command. 
                            Because of the existence of this command, the packet is passed off to 
                            msdmserv.exe, who in turn processes the packet and uses EXOLEDB to access the 
                            WSS, perform the operation and send the results back to the user in the form of 
                            XML.</p>
                        <p>
                             How 
                            do I open an older version of a document?</p>
                        <p>
                            Normally, all previous 
                            versions are located in the shadow, so if you right click a published document 
                            from within the web folders, go to properties and then the third tab, versions 
                            you can view older versions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to do this 
                            in code:
                            <br />
                            &lt;pre&gt;<br />
                            strURL = &quot;url of the last published version&quot;
                            <br />
                            Set oVersion = New PKMCDO.KnowledgeVersion
                            <br />
                            Set prmRs = oVersion.VersionHistory(strURL)
                            <br />
                            Set oVersion = Nothing
                            <br />
                            &lt;/pre&gt;<br />
                            prmRS will contain a recordset, which contains the url to the old versions in 
                            the shadow.</p>
                        <p>
                             Why 
                            do the workspace virtual directories show the error “stop sign” symbol in the 
                            IIS snap-in?</p>
                        <p>
                            If World Wide Web 
                            Publishing Service (W3SVC) starts before Microsoft Exchange Information Store 
                            (MSExchangeIS), “stop sign” symbols appear under the Default Web Site folder of 
                            the Internet Information Services console in Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

                        <p>
                            There is a dependency 
                            between the local paths of the SharePoint Portal Server virtual directories and 
                            the MSExchangeIS. You must start MSExchangeIS first, followed by W3SVC.

                            Complete the following 
                            steps to prevent the stop signs from appearing each time you restart:
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            # Change the Startup 
                            type for W3SVC to Manual.
                            <br />
                            # Restart the server. The MSExchangeIS service starts automatically.
                            <br />
                            # Start W3SVC.</p>

                             What 
                            is SharePoint from a Technical Perspective?</p>
                        <p>
                            Technically SharePoint 
                            illustrates neatly what Microsoft&#39;s .net strategy is all about: integrating 
                            Windows with the Web. Microsoft has previously made accessing stuff on a PC 
                            easier, (Windows) then on a network (NT) and now on the web (.NET). SharePoint 
                            is an application written to let a user access a web accessible directory tree 
                            called the Web Storage System.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SharePoint was written 
                            with a set of technologies that allow the programmer to pass data, functions, 
                            parameters over HTTP, the web&#39;s medium. These are XML, XSL and SOAP, to name a 
                            few I understand the basics of!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To the user it looks 
                            easy, like Hotmail, but every time they click a button or a link, a lot has to 
                            happen behind the scenes to do what they want to do quickly and powerfully. Not 
                            as easy as you might think, but SharePoint does it for you. Accessing this Web 
                            storage system and the server itself is also done using technologies like ADO, 
                            CDO, PKMCDO, LDAP, DDSC, ADSC. More on these later. SharePoint is a great 
                            example of how the Internet Platform can be extended and integrated into an 
                            existing well adopted technology, Windows.</p>
                        <p>
                             What 
                            is SharePoint from an Administration Perspective?</p>
                        <p>
                            Administering 
                            SharePoint mainly consists of setting it up, which is much easier than you 
                            expect, adding the content, which can be just dragging and dropping in whole 
                            directory structures and files, and then organizing the files better by giving 
                            them categories or other metadata. This is done either through the Web interface 
                            or through the SharePoint Client: a program what means you can access SharePoint 
                            as a Web folder and then right-click files to select options like &quot;edit 
                            profile&quot;. Or add files by dragging them in individually or in bulk.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Setting the security 
                            is also important, using NT accounts, either NT4 or Active Directory (or both in 
                            mixed mode) you can give users access to files/folders the same way as you do in 
                            standard Windows. Users can be grouped and the groups given access privileges to 
                            help manage this better. Also SharePoint has 3 Roles that a User or Group can be 
                            given on a particular item. Readers can see the item (i.e. document/file or 
                            folder) but not change it, Authors can see and edit items and coordinators can 
                            set security privileges for the part of the system they have control over. Thus, 
                            you could set 12 different coordinators for 12 different folder trees, and they 
                            could manage who can do what within that area only.</p>

                             What 
                            is SharePoint from a Users Perspective?</p>
                        <p>
                            From a Users 
                            perspective SharePoint is a way of making documents and folders on the Windows 
                            platform accessible over the web. The user visits the SharePoint Portal web 
                            page, and from there they can add documents, change documents &amp; delete 
                            documents. Through this Portal, these documents are now available for 
                            discussion, collaboration, versioning and being managed through a workflow. 
                            Hence the name &quot;Share-Point&quot;. Details about the document can be saved too, such 
                            as: who wrote it, when, for whom, its size, and version, category or target 
                            audience. These can then be used to find the document through SharePoint&#39;s 
                            Search facility. Even documents not &quot;in&quot; SharePoint can be included in the 
                            search engine&#39;s index so they become part of the portal. All in all, it&#39;s a 
                            great way to get stuff up on the web for users with average technical skills, 
                            and for administrators to manage the content.</p>

                             What 
                            are the various Sharepoint 2003 and Exchange integration points?</p>
                        <h4>
                            Link to Outlook</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is a button on 
                            contacts or events lists that lets Outlook 2003 add a pst file named Sharepoint 
                            Folders and it links to the data on the site. It’s read-only, but you could make 
                            the home page for that PST be the Sharepoint site for easier viewing. The link 
                            to outlook feature seems more to be where some can public a calendar, but not 
                            want too much collaboration. For example, a holiday schedule, company meeting 
                            schedule, etc, can be made available for people to be able to view from Outlook 
                            without having to go to a web browser. Another nice thing about OL2K3 is that 
                            you can compare these calendars with others side by side.

                        <p>
                           With SPS you can index Exchange’s public folders with the search engine so that 
                            all that precious public folder content is searchable. You’ll want to look at 
                            content sources and indexing in Sharepoint administration.p
                        </p>

                            <br />
                            Since exchange web-enables public folders, you can create a web part that 
                            displays that content. IE, will display the IT/Helpdesk public 
                            folder via OWA. So you add the Page Viewer web part to a page and point it at 
                            that URL. The key here is to add ?cmd=contents to the end of the url if you 
                            don’t want the navigator pane on the left.

                            Some of the web parts that come with SPS allow you to add a web part to a page 
                            that actually takes the users outlook info (calendar, inbox, contacts, tasks) 
                            and put them into the page.</p>

                            &quot;In Word 2003, you can 
                            compare documents side by side. Open two documents. Then, from the Window menu 
                            of one of them, select the Compare Side By Side command. If you have only two 
                            documents open, the command will automatically choose to compare them. If you 
                            have three or more documents open, you&#39;ll have to select which document to 
                            compare with the current file.

                            compatible document library - but that’s really just putting a bit of SPS 2001

                    <span>Windows SharePoint Services is the solution that enables you to create Web 
                    sites for information sharing and document collaboration. Windows SharePoint 
                    Services — a key piece of the information worker infrastructure delivered in 
                    Microsoft Windows Server 2003 — provides additional functionality to the 
                    Microsoft Office system and other desktop applications, and it serves as a 
                    platform for application development.</span></p>

                    Microsoft Windows 
                    Services is the engine that allows administrators to create Web sites for 
                    information sharing and document collaboration. Windows SharePoint Services 
                    provides additional functionality to the Microsoft Office System and other 
                    desktop applications, as well as serving as a plat form for application 
                    development. SharePoint sites provide communities for team collaboration, 
                    enabling users to work together on documents, tasks, and projects. The

                    solutions with flexible deployment and management tools. Windows SharePoint 
                    Services provides sites for team collaboration, while Share Point Portal Server 
                    connects these sites, people, and business processes—facilitating knowledge 
                    sharing and smart organizations. SharePoint Portal Server also extends the 
                    capabilities of Windows SharePoint Services by providing organizational and 
                    management tools for SharePoint sites, and by enabling teams to publish

                    intranet, extranet, and Internet applications across the enterprise.<br />
                    * Business users gain greater control over the storage, security, distribution, 
                    and management of their electronic content, with tools that are easy to use and 
                    tightly integrated into familiar, everyday applications.
                    <br />
                    * Organizations can accelerate shared business processes with customers and 
                    partners across organizational boundaries using InfoPath Forms Services–driven 
                    solutions.
                    <br />
                    * Information workers can find information and people efficiently and easily 
                    through the facilitated information-sharing functionality and simplified content 
                    publishing. In addition, access to back-end data is achieved easily through a 
                    browser, and views into this data can be personalized.
                    <br />
                    * Administrators have powerful tools at their fingertips that ease deployment, 
                    management, and system administration, so they can spend more time on strategic 
                    tasks.
                    <br />
                    * Developers have a rich platform to build a new class of applications, called 
                    Office Business Applications, that combine powerful developer functionality with 
                    the flexibility and ease of deployment of Office SharePoint Server 2007. Through 
                    the use of out-of-the-box application services, developers can build richer 
                    applications with less code.

                    If you want your site 
                    to be a public Web site, enable anonymous access for the entire site. Then you 
                    can give out your URL to anybody in your business card, e-mail or any other 
                    marketing material.  
                     </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, please take 
                    special care to name your site.<br />
                    These Web sites are ideal for information and knowledge intensive sites and/or 
                    sites where you need to have shared Web workspace.<br />
                    Remember: Under each parent Web site, you can create up to 10 sub-sites each 
                    with unique permissions, settings and security rights.</p>
                <p>
                    How 
                    do the sub sites work?</p>
                <p>
                    You can create a sub 
                    site for various categories. For example:<br />
                    * Departments - finance, marketing, IT<br />
                    * Products - electrical, mechanical, hydraulics
                    <br />
                    * Projects - Trey Research, Department of Transportation, FDA<br />
                    * Team - Retention team, BPR team<br />
                    * Clients - new clients, old clients<br />
                    * Suppliers - Supplier 1, Supplier 2, Supplier 3<br />
                    * Customers - Customer A, Customer B, Customer C<br />
                    * Real estate - property A, property B</p>
                 
                <p>
                    You can keep track of 
                    permissions for each team separately so that access is restricted while 
                    maintaining global access to the parent site.</p>
                <p>
                     How 
                    do I make my site non-restricted?</p>
                <p>
                    If you want your site 
                    to have anonymous access enabled (i.e., you want to treat it like any site on 
                    the Internet that does not ask you to provide a user name and password to see 
                    the content of the site), follow these simple steps:<br />
                    # Login as an administrator<br />
                    # Click on site settings<br />
                    # Click on Go to Site Administration<br />
                    # Click on Manage anonymous access<br />
                    # Choose one of the three conditions on what Anonymous users can access:<br />
                    ** Entire Web site<br />
                    ** Lists and libraries<br />
                    ** Nothing</p>
                <p>
                    Default condition is 
                    nothing; your site has restricted access. The default conditions allow you to 
                    create a secure site for your Web site.</p>
                <p>
                    Can 
                    I get domain name for my Web site?</p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, no. At 
                    this point, we don&#39;t offer domain names for SharePoint sites. But very soon we 
                    will be making this available for all our SharePoint site customers. Please keep 
                    checking this page for further update on this. Meanwhile, we suggest you go 
                    ahead and set up your site and create content for it.</p>

                     What 
                    are picture libraries?</p>
                <p>
                    Picture libraries 
                    allow you to access a photo album and view it as a slide show or thumbnails or a 
                    film strip. You can have separate folder for each event, category, etc</p>
                <p>
                    What 
                    are the advantages of a hosted SharePoint vs. one that is on an in-house server?</p>
                <p>
                    * No hardware 
                    investment, i.e. lower costs
                    <br />
                    * No software to download - ready to start from the word go<br />
                    * No IT resources - Anyone who has used a Web program like Hotmail can use it<br />
                    * Faster deployment</p>
                <p>
                     Can 
                    I ask users outside of my organization to participate in my Windows SharePoint 
                    Services site?</p>
                <p>
                    Yes. You can manage 
                    this process using the Administration Site Settings. Simply add users via their 
                    e-mail alias and assign permissions such as Reader or Contributor.</p>
                <p>
                     Are 
                    there any IT requirements or downloads required to set up my SharePoint site?</p>
                <p>
                    No. You do not need to 
                    download any code or plan for any IT support. Simply complete the on-line signup 
                    process and provide us your current and correct email address. Once you have 
                    successfully signed up and your site has been provisioned, we will send a 
                    confirmation to the email address you provided.</p>
                <p>
                     I am 
                    located outside of the United States. Are there any restrictions or requirements 
                    for accessing the Windows SharePoint Services?</p>
                <p>
                    No. There are no 
                    system or bandwidth limitations for international trial users. Additionally 
                    language packs have been installed which allow users to set up sub-webs in 
                    languages other than English. These include: Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, 
                    French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), 
                    Spanish and Swedish.</p>
                <p>
                     Are 
                    there any browser recommendations?</p>
                <p>
                    Yes. Microsoft 
                    recommends using the following browsers for viewing and editing Windows 
                    SharePoint Services sites: Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 with Service Pack 2, 
                    Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 with Service Pack 2, Internet Explorer 6, 
                    Netscape Navigator 6.2 or later.</p>
                <p>
                     What 
                    security levels are assigned to users?</p>
                <p>
                    Security levels are 
                    assigned by the administrator who is adding the user. There are four levels by 
                    default and additional levels can be composed as necessary.<br />
                    * Reader - Has read-only access to the Web site.<br />
                    * Contributor - Can add content to existing document libraries and lists.<br />
                    * Web Designer - Can create lists and document libraries and customize pages in 
                    the Web site.<br />
                    * Administrator - Has full control of the Web site.</p>
                <p>
                     How 
                    secure are Windows SharePoint Services sites hosted by Microsoft?</p>
                <p>
                    Microsoft Windows 
                    SharePoint Services Technical security measures provide firewall protection, 
                    intrusion detection, and web-publishing rules. The Microsoft operation center 
                    team tests and deploys software updates in order to maintain the highest level 
                    of security and software reliability. Software hot-fixes and service packs are 
                    tested and deployed based on their priority and level of risk. Security related 
                    hot-fixes are rapidly deployed into the environment to address current threats. 
                    A comprehensive software validation activity ensures software stability through 
                    regression testing prior to deployment.</p>
                 
                <p>
                     What 
                    is the difference between an Internet and an intranet site?</p>
                <p>
                    An internet site is a 
                    normal site that anyone on the internet can access (e.g.,
                    <a href="http://www.msn.com">www.msn.com</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">
                    www.microsoft.com</a>, etc.). You can set up a site for your company that can be 
                    accessed by anyone without any user name and password.</p>
                <p>
                    An intranet (or 
                    internal network), though hosted on the Web, can only be accessed by people who 
                    are members of the network. They need to have a login and password that was 
                    assigned to them when they were added to the site by the site administrator.</p>
                <p>
                     What 
                    is a workspace?</p>
                <p>
                    A site or workspace is 
                    when you want a new place for collaborating on Web pages, lists and document 
                    libraries. For example, you might create a site to manage a new team or project, 
                    collaborate on a document or prepare for a meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    What 
                    are the various kinds of roles the users can have?</p>
                <p>
                    A user can be assigned 
                    one of the following roles<br />
                    * Reader - Has read-only access to the Web site.<br />
                    * Contributor - Can add content to existing document libraries and lists.<br />
                    * Web Designer - Can create lists and document libraries and customize pages in 
                    the Web site.<br />
                    * Administrator - Has full control of the Web site.</p>
                <p>
                     Can 
                    more than one person use the same login?</p>
                <p>
                    If the users sharing 
                    that login will have the same permissions and there is no fear of them sharing a 
                    password, then yes. Otherwise, this is discouraged.</p>
                <p>
                     How 
                    customizable is the user-to-user access?</p>
                <p>
                    User permissions apply 
                    to an entire Web, not to documents themselves. However, you can have additional 
                    sub webs that can optionally have their own permissions. Each user can be given 
                    any of four default roles. Additional roles can be defined by the administrator.</p>
                <p>
                     Can 
                    each user have access to their own calendar?</p>
                <p>
                    Yes there are two ways 
                    to do this,<br />
                    * by creating a calendar for each user, or<br />
                    * by creating a calendar with a view for each user</p>
                <p>
                     How 
                    many files can I upload?</p>
                <p>
                    There is no 
                    restriction in place except that any storage consumed beyond that provided by 
                    the base offering may have an additional monthly charge associated with them.</p>
                <p>
                     What 
                    types of files can I upload / post to the site?</p>
                <p>
                    The only files 
                    restricted are those ending with the following extensions: .asa, .asp, .ida, 
                    .idc, .idq.&nbsp; Microsoft reserves the right to add additional file types to 
                    this listing at any time.&nbsp; Also, no content that violates the terms of 
                    service may be uploaded or posted to the site.</p>
                <p>
                    Can 
                    SharePoint be linked to an external data source?</p>
                <p>
                    SharePoint data can be 
                    opened with Access and Excel as an external data source. Thus, SharePoint can be 
                    referenced as an external data source. SharePoint itself cannot reference an 
                    external data source.</p>
                <p>
                     Can 
                    SharePoint be linked to a SQL database?</p>
                <p>
                    This is possible via a 
                    custom application, but it not natively supported by SharePoint or SQL Server.</p>
                <p>
                     Can 
                    I customize my Windows SharePoint Services site?</p>
                <p>
                    YES! Windows 
                    SharePoint Services makes updating sites and their content from the browser 
                    easier then ever.</p>
                <p>
                    SharePoint includes 
                    tools that let you create custom lists, calendars, page views, etc. You can 
                    apply a theme; add List, Survey and Document Library Web Parts to a page; create 
                    personal views; change logos; connect Web Parts and more.</p>
                <p>
                    To fully customize 
                    your site, you can use Microsoft FrontPage 2003. Specifically, you can use 
                    FrontPage themes and shared borders, and also use FrontPage to create photo 
                    galleries and top ten lists, utilize standard usage reports, and integrate 
                    automatic Web content.</p>

                     What 
                    are the features that the portal components of Office SharePoint Server 2007 
                    include?</p>
                <p>
                    The portal components 
                    of Office SharePoint Server 2007 include features that are especially useful for 
                    designing, deploying, and managing enterprise intranet portals, corporate 
                    Internet Web sites, and divisional portal sites. The portal components make it 
                    easier to connect to people within the organization who have the right skills, 
                    knowledge, and project experience.</p>

                    of the new Content management in Office SharePoint 2007?</p>
                <p>
                    The new and enhanced 
                    content management features in Office SharePoint Server 2007 fall within three 
                    areas:<br />
                    * Document management
                    <br />
                    * Records management
                    <br />
                    * Web content management
                    <br />
                    Office SharePoint Server 2007 builds on the core document management 
                    functionality provided by Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, including check in 
                    and check out, versioning, metadata, and role-based granular access controls. 
                    Organizations can use this functionality to deliver enhanced authoring, business 
                    document processing, Web content management and publishing, records management, 
                    policy management, and support for multilingual publishing.

                <p>
                    The search component 
                    of Office SharePoint Server 2007 has been significantly enhanced by this release 
                    of SharePoint Products and Technologies. New features provide:<br />

                     What 
                    are the benefits of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007?</p>
                <p>
                    
                    <br />
                    * Provide a simple, familiar, and consistent user experience.<br />
                    * Boost employee productivity by simplifying everyday business activities.<br />
                    * Help meet regulatory requirements through comprehensive control over content.<br />
                    * Effectively manage and repurpose content to gain increased business value.<br />
                    * Simplify organization-wide access to both structured and unstructured 
                    information across disparate systems.<br />
                    * Connect people with information and expertise.<br />
                    * Accelerate shared business processes across organizational boundaries.<br />
                    * Share business data without divulging sensitive information.<br />
                    * Enable people to make better-informed decisions by presenting 
                    business-critical information in one central location.<br />
                    * Provide a single, integrated platform to manage intranet, extranet, and 
                    Internet applications across the enterprise.</p>

                     Will 
                    SharePoint Portal Server and Team Services ever merge?</p>
                <p>
                    The products will come 
                    together because they are both developed by the Office team.

                <p>
                     What 
                    does partial trust mean the Web Part developer?</p>
                <p>
                    If an assembly is 
                    installed into the BIN directory, the code must be ensured that provides error 
                    handling in the event that required permissions are not available. Otherwise, 
                    unhandled security exceptions may cause the Web Part to fail and may affect page 
                    rendering on the page where the Web Part appears.</p>
                <p>
                     How 
                    can I raise the trust level for assemblies installed in the BIN directory?</p>
                <p>
                    Windows SharePoint 
                    Services can use any of the following three options from ASP.NET and the CLR to 
                    provide assemblies installed in the BIN directory with sufficient permissions. 
                    The following table outlines the implications and requirements for each option.</p>
                <p>
                    Option&nbsp;Pros&nbsp;Cons</p>
                <p>
                    Increase the trust 
                    level for the entire virtual server. For more information, see &quot;Setting the 
                    trust level for a virtual server&quot;&nbsp;Easy to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a development 
                    environment, increasing the trust level allows you to test an assembly with 
                    increased permissions while allowing you to recompile assemblies directly into 
                    the BIN directory without resetting IIS.&nbsp;This option is least secure.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    This option affects 
                    all assemblies used by the virtual server.<br />
                    There is no guarantee the destination server has the required trust level. 
                    Therefore, Web Parts may not work once installed on the destination server.</p>
                <p>
                    Create a custom policy 
                    file for your assemblies. For more information, see &quot;How do I create a custom 
                    policy file?&quot;&nbsp;Recommended approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This option is most 
                    secure.</p>
                <p>
                    An assembly can 
                    operate with a unique policy that meets the minimum permission requirements for 
                    the assembly.</p>
                <p>
                    By creating a custom 
                    security policy, you can ensure the destination server can run your Web Parts.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    Requires the most 
                    configuration of all three options.<br />
                    Install your assemblies in the GAC&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    Easy to implement.
                    <br />
                    This grants Full trust to your assembly without affecting the trust level of 
                    assemblies installed in the BIN directory.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    This option is less 
                    secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assemblies installed 
                    in the GAC are available to all virtual servers and applications on a server 
                    running Windows SharePoint Services. This could represent a potential security 
                    risk as it potentially grants a higher level of permission to your assembly 
                    across a larger scope than necessary</p>
                <p>
                    In a development 
                    environment, you must reset IIS every time you recompile assemblies.</p>
                <p>
                    Licensing issues may 
                    arise due to the global availability of your assembly.</p>
                <p>
                    Does 
                    SharePoint work with NFS?</p>
                <p>
                    Yes and no. It can 
                    crawl documents on an NFS volume, but the sharepoint database or logs cannot be 
                    stored there.</p>
                <p>
                     How 
                    is SharePoint Portal Server different from the Site Server?</p>
                <p>
                    Site Server has search 
                    capabilities but these are more advanced using SharePoint. SPS uses digital 
                    dashboard technology which
                    <br />
                    provides a nice interface for creating web parts and showing them on dashboards 
                    (pages). SS doesn&#39;t have anything as advanced as that. The biggest difference 
                    would be SPS document management features which also integrate with web folders 
                    and MS Office.</p>
                <p>
                     What 
                    would you like to see in the next version of SharePoint?</p>
                <p>
                    A few suggestions:
                    
                </p>
                <p>

                    Why 
                    Sharepoint is not a viable solution for enterprise wide deployments?</p>
                <p>
                    Document management 
                    does not scale beyond a single server, but scales great within a single server. 
                    For example, a quad Xeon machine with 4GB of RAM works great for a document 
                    management server that has about 900,000 - 1,000,000 document, but if you need 
                    to store 50,000,000 document and want to have them all in one single workspace 
                    then it does not scale at all. If you need a scenario like this, you need to 
                    plan your deployment right and it should scale for you, it just does not right 
                    out of the box.
                    <br />
                    If you are using your server as a portal and search server most for the most 
                    part it scales great. You can have many different servers crawl content sources 
                    and have separate servers searching and serving the content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have &lt; 750,000 
                    documents per server and fewer than 4 content sources and fewer than 50,000 
                    users, SPS should scale just fine for your needs with the proper planning.</p>
                <p>
                     What 
                    are the actual advantages of SharePoint Portal Services (SPS) over SharePoint 
                    Team Services (STS)?</p>
                <p>
                    SharePoint Portal 
                    Services (SPS) has MUCH better document management. It has check-in, check-out, 
                    versioning, approval, publishing, subscriptions, categories, etc. STS does not 
                    have these features, or they are very scaled back. SharePoint team Services 
                    (SPS) has a better search engine, and can crawl multiple content sources. STS 
                    cannot. STS is easier to manage and much better for a team environment where 
                    there is not much Document Management going on. SPS is better for an 
                    organization, or where Document Management is crucial.</p>
                <p>
                     How 
                    Does SharePoint work?</p>
                <p>
                    The browser sends a 
                    DAV packet to IIS asking to perform a document check in. PKMDASL.DLL, an ISAPI 
                    DLL, parses the packet and sees that it has the proprietary INVOKE command. 
                    Because of the existence of this command, the packet is passed off to 
                    msdmserv.exe, who in turn processes the packet and uses EXOLEDB to access the 
                    WSS, perform the operation and send the results back to the user in the form of 
                    XML.</p>
                <p>
                     How 
                    do I open an older version of a document?</p>
                <p>
                    Normally, all previous 
                    versions are located in the shadow, so if you right click a published document 
                    from within the web folders, go to properties and then the third tab, versions 
                    you can view older versions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to do this 
                    in code:
                    <br />
                    &lt;pre&gt;<br />
                    strURL = &quot;url of the last published version&quot;
                    <br />
                    Set oVersion = New PKMCDO.KnowledgeVersion
                    <br />
                    Set prmRs = oVersion.VersionHistory(strURL)
                    <br />
                    Set oVersion = Nothing
                    <br />
                    &lt;/pre&gt;<br />
                    prmRS will contain a recordset, which contains the url to the old versions in 
                    the shadow.</p>
                <p>
                    Why 
                    do the workspace virtual directories show the error “stop sign” symbol in the 
                    IIS snap-in?</p>
                <p>
                    If World Wide Web 
                    Publishing Service (W3SVC) starts before Microsoft Exchange Information Store 
                    (MSExchangeIS), “stop sign” symbols appear under the Default Web Site folder of 
                    the Internet Information Services console in Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a dependency 
                    between the local paths of the SharePoint Portal Server virtual directories and 
                    the MSExchangeIS. You must start MSExchangeIS first, followed by W3SVC.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Complete the following 
                    steps to prevent the stop signs from appearing each time you restart:
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    # Change the Startup 
                    type for W3SVC to Manual.
                    <br />
                    # Restart the server. The MSExchangeIS service starts automatically.
                    <br />
                    # Start W3SVC.</p>
                <p>
                    What 
                    newsgroups are available?</p>
                <p>
                    There are two,
                    <br />

                    <br />

                    What 
                    is SharePoint from a Technical Perspective?</p>
                <p>
                    Technically SharePoint 
                    illustrates neatly what Microsoft&#39;s .net strategy is all about: integrating 
                    Windows with the Web. Microsoft has previously made accessing stuff on a PC 
                    easier, (Windows) then on a network (NT) and now on the web (.NET). SharePoint 
                    is an application written to let a user access a web accessible directory tree 
                    called the Web Storage System.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SharePoint was written 
                    with a set of technologies that allow the programmer to pass data, functions, 
                    parameters over HTTP, the web&#39;s medium. These are XML, XSL and SOAP, to name a 
                    few I understand the basics of!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the user it looks 
                    easy, like Hotmail, but every time they click a button or a link, a lot has to 
                    happen behind the scenes to do what they want to do quickly and powerfully. Not 
                    as easy as you might think, but SharePoint does it for you. Accessing this Web 
                    storage system and the server itself is also done using technologies like ADO, 
                    CDO, PKMCDO, LDAP, DDSC, ADSC. More on these later. SharePoint is a great 
                    example of how the Internet Platform can be extended and integrated into an 
                    existing well adopted technology, Windows.</p>
                <p>
                    What 
                    is SharePoint from an Administration Perspective?</p>
                <p>
                    Administering 
                    SharePoint mainly consists of setting it up, which is much easier than you 
                    expect, adding the content, which can be just dragging and dropping in whole 
                    directory structures and files, and then organizing the files better by giving 
                    them categories or other metadata. This is done either through the Web interface 
                    or through the SharePoint Client: a program what means you can access SharePoint 
                    as a Web folder and then right-click files to select options like &quot;edit 
                    profile&quot;. Or add files by dragging them in individually or in bulk.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setting the security 
                    is also important, using NT accounts, either NT4 or Active Directory (or both in 
                    mixed mode) you can give users access to files/folders the same way as you do in 
                    standard Windows. Users can be grouped and the groups given access privileges to 
                    help manage this better. Also SharePoint has 3 Roles that a User or Group can be 
                    given on a particular item. Readers can see the item (i.e. document/file or 
                    folder) but not change it, Authors can see and edit items and coordinators can 
                    set security privileges for the part of the system they have control over. Thus, 
                    you could set 12 different coordinators for 12 different folder trees, and they 
                    could manage who can do what within that area only.</p>
                <p>
                    What 
                    is SharePoint from a Users Perspective?</p>
                <p>
                    From a Users 
                    perspective SharePoint is a way of making documents and folders on the Windows 
                    platform accessible over the web. The user visits the SharePoint Portal web 
                    page, and from there they can add documents, change documents &amp; delete 
                    documents. Through this Portal, these documents are now available for 
                    discussion, collaboration, versioning and being managed through a workflow. 
                    Hence the name &quot;Share-Point&quot;. Details about the document can be saved too, such 
                    as: who wrote it, when, for whom, its size, and version, category or target 
                    audience. These can then be used to find the document through SharePoint&#39;s 
                    Search facility. Even documents not &quot;in&quot; SharePoint can be included in the 
                    search engine&#39;s index so they become part of the portal. All in all, it&#39;s a 
                    great way to get stuff up on the web for users with average technical skills, 
                    and for administrators to manage the content.</p>
                <p>
                    What 
                    are the various Sharepoint 2003 and Exchange integration points?</p>
                <h4>
                    Link to Outlook</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a button on 
                    contacts or events lists that lets Outlook 2003 add a pst file named Sharepoint 
                    Folders and it links to the data on the site. It’s read-only, but you could make 
                    the home page for that PST be the Sharepoint site for easier viewing. The link 
                    to outlook feature seems more to be where some can public a calendar, but not 
                    want too much collaboration. For example, a holiday schedule, company meeting 
                    schedule, etc, can be made available for people to be able to view from Outlook 
                    without having to go to a web browser. Another nice thing about OL2K3 is that 
                    you can compare these calendars with others side by side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Searching Public 
                    Folders</p>
                <p>
                    With SPS you can index Exchange’s public folders with the search engine so that 
                    all that precious public folder content is searchable. You’ll want to look at 
                    content sources and indexing in Sharepoint administration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Displaying Public 
                    Folders in a web part</p>
                <p> 
                    Since exchange web-enables public folders, you can create a web part that 
                    displays that content. IE, will display the IT/Helpdesk public 
                    folder via OWA. So you add the Page Viewer web part to a page and point it at 
                    that URL. The key here is to add ?cmd=contents to the end of the url if you 
                    don’t want the navigator pane on the left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smart web parts</p>
                <p>
                    Some of the web parts that come with SPS allow you to add a web part to a page 
                    that actually takes the users outlook info (calendar, inbox, contacts, tasks) 
                    and put them into the page.</p>
                <p>
                    Can 
                    SharePoint compare two document versions?</p>
                <p>
                    &quot;In Word 2003, you can 
                    compare documents side by side. Open two documents. Then, from the Window menu 
                    of one of them, select the Compare Side By Side command. If you have only two 
                    documents open, the command will automatically choose to compare them. If you 
                    have three or more documents open, you&#39;ll have to select which document to 
                    compare with the current file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A floating toolbar 
                    with two buttons will open. If the button on the left is selected, Word will 
                    scroll both documents at the same time. Press the button on the right side of 
                    the toolbar to return to where the cursor was located when you started 
                    comparing.&quot;</p>
                <p>
                     What 
                    are the integration differences between SPS 2003 and the various Office 
                    versions?</p>
                <p>
                    SPS webpage can detect 
                    you have installed the Office 2003 and run local dll to implement some SPS 
                    function, e.g. multi-file upload only works when you have office 2003 installed.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integration with 
                    Office XP is gone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will get guys 
                    telling you that you can integrate with SPSv2 if you install a backwards 
                    compatible document library - but that’s really just putting a bit of SPS 2001 
                    on the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Believe me, check-in, 
                    check-out, which are themselves very basic, are not available from inside Office 
                    XP, or even from the context menu in Windows Explorer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ONLY option you 
                    have is to use the web interface to check-in or check-out.</p>
