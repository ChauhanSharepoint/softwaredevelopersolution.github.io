                        <p>
                            <span>&nbsp;Locking is the most common type of concurrency control mechanism. In this 
                            approach, any data is retrieved by an active user for updating, must be locked 
                            or denied to other users until updating is not complete.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Locking is of three types,

                            <span>&nbsp;A &quot;Dead Lock&quot; happens when two or more transaction is locked from a

                            <span>&nbsp;Suppose there are two sets of attributes, X and Y. Then Y is said to be

                            then restore it and again put the database in MULTI USER mode. Make sure, you 
                            are always using MASTER database for this operation.

                            <span>&nbsp;An execution plan is basically a road map that graphically or textually 
                            shows the data retrieval methods chosen by the SQL Server query optimizer for a 
                            stored procedure or ad-hoc query and is a very useful tool for a developer to 
                            understand the performance characteristics of a query or stored procedure since 
                            the plan is the one that SQL Server will place in its cache and use to execute 
                            the stored procedure or query. From within Query Analyzer is an option called 
                            &quot;Show Execution Plan&quot; (located on the Query drop-down menu). If this option is 
                            turned on it will display query execution plan in separate window when query is

                            <span>&nbsp;Log shipping is the process of automating the backup of database and 
                            transaction log files on a production SQL server, and then restoring them onto a 
                            standby server. Enterprise Editions only supports log shipping. In log shipping 
                            the transactional log file from one server is automatically updated into the 
                            backup database on the other server. If one server fails, the other server will 
                            have the same db and can be used this as the Disaster Recovery plan. The key 
                            feature of log shipping is that it will automatically backup transaction logs 
                            throughout the day and automatically restore them on the standby server at 
                            defined interval.</span></p>

                        <p>
                            <span>&nbsp;SQL Profiler is a graphical tool that allows system administrators to 
                            monitor events in an instance of Microsoft SQL Server. You can capture and save 
                            data about each event to a file or SQL Server table to analyze later. For 
                            example, you can monitor a production environment to see which stored procedures 
                            are hampering performances by executing too slowly.
                            <br />
                            Use SQL Profiler to monitor only the events in which you are interested. If 
                            traces are becoming too large, you can filter them based on the information you 
                            want, so that only a subset of the event data is collected. Monitoring too many 
                            events adds overhead to the server and the monitoring process and can cause the 
                            trace file or trace table to grow very large, especially when the monitoring 
                            process takes place over a long period of time.</span></p>

                            one copy of the database is currently available to clients which are known as

                            applied on the other copy of the database, known as the mirror database. 
                            Mirroring involves applying the transaction log from every insertion, update, or

                        <p>
                            <span>&nbsp;Better one is table variable.
                            <br /> 
                            In most of our real time scenario we are using the temp table which is 
                            physically created in tempdb. This creates overhead, but when you create a table 
                            Variable it only resides in the memory which clearly shows that it will be much 
                            faster than Temp table.
                            <br />
                            A table variable goes out of scope immediately after the batch end. If we use 
                            Table Variable then we no need to explicitly drop it.</span></p>

                             What is Wildcard

                        <p>
                            <span>&nbsp;Wildcard characters Determines whether a given character string matches a 
                            specified pattern.
                            <br />
                            A pattern can include regular characters and wildcard characters.
                            <br />
                            During pattern matching, regular characters must match exactly the characters 
                            specified in the character string. Wildcard characters, however, can be matched 
                            with arbitrary fragments of the character string.
                            <br />
                            Using wildcard characters makes the LIKE operator more flexible than using the = 
                            and != string comparison operators.
                            <br />

                            Reason : Because UNION ALL statement does not look for duplicate rows, but on

                        <p>
                            <span>&nbsp;Mainly There are three types of locks in SQL Server :
                            <br /> 
                            (1)Shared locks are used for operations that does not allow to change or update 
                            data, such as a SELECT statement.
                            <br />
                            (2)Update locks are used when SQL Server intends to modify a page, and later 
                            promotes the update page lock to an exclusive page lock before actually making 
                            the changes.
                            <br />
                            (3)Exclusive locks are used for the data modification operations, such as 
                            UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE.</span></p>

                        <p>
                            <span>Both Clauses are used to check the Condition at the time of Retrieval of 
                            records in Database.
                            <br />
                            WHERE Clause is applied to each row before they are part of the GROUP BY 
                            function in a query.
                            <br />
                            Having Clause is basically used only with the GROUP BY function in a query.</span></p>

                            ROLLBACK do the same thing just terminate the current transaction but one

                            It is possible to create an index on one or more columns of a table, and each 
                            index is given a name.
                            <br />

                            Clustered index are physical form of sorting. Therefore only one clustered index 
                            can be created on each table because the data rows themselves can only be sorted 
                            in one order.

                            Non clustered indexes are logical form of sorting. Therefore more than one non

                            A Clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table and is 
                            particularly efficient on columns that are often searched for ranges of values.
                            <br />
                            The leaf nodes of a clustered index contain the data pages.
                            <br />
                            There can be only one clustered index per table.
                            <br />
                            &quot;Primary key&quot; is the ideal column for a clustered index
                            <br />
                            Clustered indexes are good for range searches.

                            Nonclustered index is a special type of index in which the logical order of the 
                            index does not match the physical stored order of the rows on disk.
                            <br />
                            The leaf node of a nonclustered index does not consist of the data pages. 
                            Instead, the leaf nodes contain index rows.
                            <br />
                            There can be multiple non-clustered indexes per table.

                            Sometimes before using SIGN(), you need to confirm you are passing numeric value

                            When it is set to ON, the concatenation will result null and when it is set to

                            <br />
                            You can create only one clustered index in table.

                            Either you can create index on entire table or you can create clustered index on 
                            a view covering entire table.

                        <p>
                            <span>&nbsp;A local temporary table exists only for the duration of a connection or, 
                            if defined inside a compound statement, for the duration of the compound 
                            statement.
                            <br /> 
                            Global temporary tables (created with a double “##”) are visible to all 
                            sessions. You should always check for existence of the global temporary table 
                            before creating it… if it already exists, then you will get a duplicate object 
                            error.
                            <br /> 
                            Global temporary tables are dropped when the session that created it ends, and 
                            all other sessions have stopped referencing it.</span></p>

                            <span>&nbsp;ROW_NUMBER() returns a column as an expression that conation’s the row 
                            number within the result set. This is only a number used in the context of the 
                            result set, if the result changes, the ROW_NUMBER () will change.</span></p>

                        <p>
                            <span>&nbsp;First Get the n records from the table using
                            <br /> 
                            Select Top n FROM UserTable
                            <br />
                            Now Reverse the Order using identity Column like:
                            <br />
                            Select Top n FROM UserTable Order By 1 DESC
                            <br /> 
                            Now we need nth record that can be get as
                            <br />
                            SELECT TOP 1 * FROM (Select Top n FROM UserTable Order By 1 DESC)AC
                            <br /> 
                            For Example i need to get 5th record From userTable then quey will be like this:

                        <p>
                            <span>&nbsp;Unique key column by default creates a non-cluster index on the column. 
                            Primary key creates cluster index on the column. The only difference is Unique 
                            key column allows only one null value. So is it possible to have cluster index 
                            on unique key column?
                            <br /> 
                            The answer is YES. Though unique key allows null value but it still maintains 
                            the uniqueness of the column.</span></p>

                            <span>&nbsp;Both primary key and unique enforce uniqueness of the column on which 
                            they are defined. But by default primary key creates a clustered index on the 
                            column, where are unique creates a nonclustered index by default. Another major 
                            difference is that, primary key doesn’t allow NULLs, but unique key allows one 
                            NULL only.</span></p>

                            source database. This allows you to have a backup server and also provides a way 
                            to offload query processing from the main computer (the source server) to 
                            read-only destination servers.</span></p>

                            <span>ACID (an acronymn for Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability) is a 
                            concept that Database Professionals generally look for when evaluating databases 
                            and application architectures. For a reliable database all this four attributes 
                            should be achieved.
                            <br /> 
                            Atomicity is an all-or-none proposition.
                            <br /> 
                            Consistency guarantees that a transaction never leaves your database in a 
                            half-finished state.
                            <br /> 
                            Isolation keeps transactions separated from each other until they’re finished.
                            <br /> 
                            Durability guarantees that the database will keep track of pending changes in 
                            such a way that the server can recover from an abnormal termination.
                            <br />
