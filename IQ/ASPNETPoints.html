                            A lot is going on in this single node, but the setting that takes care of the 
                            size of the files to be uploaded is the maxRequestLength attribute. By default, 
                            this is set to 4096 kilobytes (KB). Simply change this value to increase the 
                            size of the files that you can upload to the server. If you want to allow 10 
                            megabyte (MB) files to be uploaded to the server, set the maxRequestLength value 
                            to 11264, meaning that the application allows files that are up to 11000 KB to 
                            be uploaded to the server.</span></p>

                            it is stored in a database.

                            For example we can use profiles we can keep track of the products ordered by an

                            <span>The ValidationSummary control allows you to summarize the error messages 
                            from all validation controls on a Web page in a single location. The summary can 
                            be displayed as a list, a bulleted list, or a single paragraph, based on the 
                            value of the DisplayMode property. The error message displayed in the 
                            ValidationSummary control for each validation control on the page is specified 
                            by the ErrorMessage property of each validation control. If the ErrorMessage 
                            property of the validation control is not set, no error message is displayed in 
                            the ValidationSummary control for that validation control. You can also specify 
                            a custom title in the heading section of the ValidationSummary control by 
                            setting the HeaderText property.

                            setting the ShowSummary property. The summary can also be displayed in a message

                            You can set it to true or false as per your requirement but in fact it will not

                            <span>Well, both the properties are associated with asp.net control. The 
                            difference is Unique ID has <b>&#39;$&#39; </b>(Dollar) sign and Client ID adds <b>&#39;_&#39;</b> 
                            (hyphen) to the control, if master page is used.
                            <br /> 
                            Let&#39;s say you have placed a text box called &#39;txtName&#39; in content place holder. 
                            So client ID will be ct100_ContentPlaceHolder1_txtName where Unique ID will be 
                            ct100$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtName.
                            <br /> 
                            ClientID is used to access control in Java Script where using Unique ID you can 
                            make a post back using java script <b>__doPostBack()</b> function.

                        <p>
                            <span>With dynamic pages, sometimes you need to create titles dynamically. At 
                            such stage you can not go back to check whether they are stored in proper Title 
                            case or not. To make this task happen you can use string class provided 
                            toUpper() and toLower() methods but that would be much time consuming and 
                            tedious job. You can use, titlecase() method to make it single linear task.

                        <p>
                            <span>SmartNavigation is the property used in &lt;%@ Page %&gt; tag.
                            <br />
                            It works with 1.1 &amp; versions before it.
                            <br />
                            For Version 2.0 and next instead of it we can use &quot;SetFocus&quot; and 
                            &quot;MaintainScrollPositionOnPostBack&quot;.
                            <br /> 
                            Smart Navigation basically enhances a web pages in the following way:
                            <br /> 
                            1. The scroll position of a Web page is maintained after postback.
                            <br />
                            2. The element focus on a Web page is maintained during navigation.
                            <br />
                            3. Only the most recent Web page state is retained in the Web browser history 
                            folder.
                            <br />
                            4. The flicker effect that may occur on a Web page during navigation is 
                            minimized.</span></p>

                            is an image with some distorted text. It can have only alphabets, numbers or 
                            both depend on the programmer.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It is used to stop spamming as using web bots the process of sign up or 
                            submitting feedback can be made automatic. But having Captcha as additional 
                            level input stops web bots from doing successful spamming as web bots cannot 
                            read Captcha image content.</span></p>

                            Theme attribute. They are kept in place, if you apply the page’s theme using the 
                            StylesheetTheme attribute. Suppose you have a text box control like the 
                            following: </span>

                             What is the easiest way to bring down any website in ASP.NET?</span></b></p>
                        
                        <p>
                            <span>There is a simple way to bring down your ASP.NET 2.0 application. The only 
                            thing you have to do is to create simple html file called App_offline.htm and 
                            deploy it to your ASP.NET 2.0 web application root directory. The rest is 
                            handled by ASP.NET runtime internal routines.
                            <br /> 
                            The way app_offline.htm works is that you put the file in the root directory of 
                            the application. When ASP.NET sees it, it will shut-down the app-domain for the 
                            application (and not restart it for requests) and instead send back the contents 
                            of the App_offline.htm file in response to all new dynamic requests for the 
                            application. When you are done updating the site, just delete the file and it 
                            will come back online.</span></p>

                            becomes browser specific. You can handle such situation by specifying server

                            <br /> 
                            But in case of server side validation with custom validator, you need to be 
                            assured that the control being validated is visible and having value.

                            disabled, then any website will not be able to create cookies on user&#39;s machine.

                            retains values between multiple requests for the same page. When an ASP.NET page 
                            is processed, the current state of the page and controls is hashed into a string 
                            and saved in the page as a hidden field. If the data is too long for a single 
                            field (as specified in the MaxPageStateField-Length property), then ASP.NET 
                            performs view state chunking to split it across multiple hidden fields.</span></p>

                            <span>For any web programmer, its obvious to think and believe that SessionId 
                            remains same through out the user session and it was right till asp.net1.1. But 
                            in asp.net2.0, this behavior has changed. In the asp.net application new 
                            sessionid is returned with the response to every request until session objects 
                            are not used.
                            <br /> 
                            According to MSDN the reason/solution is:
                            <br /> 
                            “When using cookie-based session state, ASP.NET does not allocate storage for 
                            session data until the Session object is used. As a result, a new session ID is 
                            generated for each page request until the session object is accessed. If your 
                            application requires a static session ID for the entire session, you can either 
                            implement the Session_Start method in the application’s Global.asax file and 
                            store data in the Session object to fix the session ID, or you can use code in 
                            another part of your application to explicitly store data in the Session 
                            object.” </span></p>

                            The object with an absolute expiration period of say 1minute , will expire

                            Now here the objects expiration period varies according to the access of the 
                            object.

                            script. Postback is an expensive call with processing overhead. In callback a 
                            client function sends a request and a special marked method is invoked on the
                            <br />
                            server. It does the processing &amp; returns the value which is received by another 
                            client function to process the result. To have client side callbacks, the page 
                            has to implement ICallbackEventHandler &amp; implement functions RaiseCallBackEvent 
                            &amp; GetCallBackResult.

                            PostBack: Postback is the event which sends the form data to the server. The 
                            server processes the data &amp; sends it back to the browser. The page goes through

                            The AutoEventWireup attribute may have a value of true or false. When an ASP.NET 
                            Web Application is created by using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET, the value of 
                            the AutoEventWireup attribute is set as false.

                            We can specify the default value of the AutoEventWireup attribute in the

                            Strings are immutable. immutable means every time we alter the string a new 
                            object is created. hence lower the performance. while stringBuilder are mutable. 
                            so it increase the performance where we need to perform altered, insert and 
                            remove operations. But it is not recommended to use StringBuilder always. for 
                            small string where you need to perform less operation then use string
                            <br />
                            and in case of large string and more operation use StringBuilder.</span></p>

                        <p>
                            <span>A cookie dictionary is a single cookie object that stores multiple pieces 
                            of information. You use the Values property to access and assign new values to 
                            the cookie dictionary.</span></p>

                         <p>
                            <span>Persistent Cookies are same as Session Cookies except that, persistent 
                            cookies have an expiration date. The expiration date indicates to the browser 
                            that it should write the cookie to the client&#39;s hard drive
                            <br />
                            . Keep in mind that because a user can delete cookies from their machine that 
                            there is no guarantee that a cookie you &quot;drop&quot; on a user machine will be there 
                            the next time they visit your site.</span></p>

                            Type , therefore internally they contain a value type , which can be obtained 
                            through explicit casting . For any other Reference type , they don’t internally 
                            contain a Value type to Unboxed via explicit casting . This is why only boxed

                            <span>ASP.NET ViewState is a new kind of state service that developers can use 
                            to track UI state on a per-user basis. Internally it uses an an old Web

                        <p>
                            <span>State management is the process by which you maintain state and page 
                            information over multiple requests for the same or different pages.
                            <br />
                            There are 2 types State Management:
                            <br /> 
                            1. Client – Side State Management
                            <br />
                            This stores information on the client&#39;s computer by embedding the information 
                            into a Web page, a uniform resource locator(url), or a cookie. The techniques 
                            available to store the state information at the client end are listed down 
                            below:
                            <br /> 
                            a. View State – Asp.Net uses View State to track the values in the Controls. You 
                            can add custom values to the view state. It is used by the Asp.net page 
                            framework to automatically save the values of the page and of each control just 
                            prior to rendering to the page. When the page is posted, one of the first tasks 
                            performed by page processing is to restore view state.
                            <br /> 
                            b. Control State – If you create a custom control that requires view state to 
                            work properly, you should use control state to ensure other developers don’t 
                            break your control by disabling view state.
                            <br /> 
                            c. Hidden fields – Like view state, hidden fields store data in an HTML form 
                            without displaying it in the user&#39;s browser. The data is available only when the 
                            form is processed.
                            <br /> 
                            d. Cookies – Cookies store a value in the user&#39;s browser that the browser sends 
                            with every page request to the same server. Cookies are the best way to store 
                            state data that must be available for multiple Web pages on a web site.
                            <br /> 
                            e. Query Strings - Query strings store values in the URL that are visible to the 
                            user. Use query strings when you want a user to be able to e-mail or instant 
                            message state data with a URL.
                            <br /> 
                            2. Server – Side State Management
                            <br />
                            a. Application State - Application State information is available to all pages, 
                            regardless of which user requests a page.
                            <br /> 
                            b. Session State – Session State information is available to all pages opened by 
                            a user during a single visit.
                            <br /> 
                            Both application state and session state information is lost when the 
                            application restarts. To persist user data between application restarts, you can 
                            store it using profile properties.</span></p>

                        <p>
                            <span>First of all, we need a HTML server control to allow the user to select 
                            the file. This is nothing but the same old &lt;input tag, with the type set to 
                            File, such as &lt;input type=file id=”myFile” runat=server /&gt;. This will give you 
                            the textbox and a browse button. Once you have this, the user can select any 
                            file from their computer (or even from a network). Then, in the Server side, we 
                            need the following line to save the file to the Web Server.

                        <p>
                            <span>In earlier versions of IIS, if we wanted to send a user to a new Web page, 
                            the only option we had was Response.Redirect. While this method does accomplish 
                            our goal, it has several important drawbacks. The biggest problem is that this 
                            method causes each page to be treated as a separate transaction. Besides making 
                            it difficult to maintain your transactional integrity, Response.Redirect 
                            introduces some additional headaches. First, it prevents good encapsulation of 
                            code. Second, you lose access to all of the properties in the Request object. 
                            Sure, there are workarounds, but they&#39;re difficult. Finally, Response.Redirect 
                            necessitates a round trip to the client, which, on high-volume sites, causes 
                            scalability problems.
                            <br />
                            As you might suspect, Server.Transfer fixes all of these problems. It does this 
                            by performing the transfer on the server without requiring a roundtrip to the 
                            client.</span></p>

                            like sockets, uploading, etc. For these you have to make a custom components 
                            usually in VB or VC++. Client side scripting means that the script will be 
                            executed immediately in the browser such as form field validation, clock, email 
                            validation, etc. Client side scripting is usually done in VBScript or 
                            JavaScript. Download time, browser compatibility, and visible code - since 
                            JavaScript and VBScript code is included in the HTML page, then anyone can see

                        <p>
                            <span>AspCompat is an aid in migrating ASP pages to ASPX pages. It defaults to 
                            false but should be set to true in any ASPX file that creates apartment-threaded 
                            COM objects--that is, COM objects registered ThreadingModel=Apartment. That 
                            includes all COM objects written with Visual Basic 6.0. AspCompat should also be 
                            set to true (regardless of threading model) if the page creates COM objects that 
                            access intrinsic ASP objects such as Request and Response. The following 
                            directive sets AspCompat to true:
                            <br /> 
                            &lt;%@ Page AspCompat=&quot;true&quot; %&gt;
                            <br /> 
                            Setting AspCompat to true does two things. First, it makes intrinsic ASP objects 
                            available to the COM components by placing unmanaged wrappers around the 
                            equivalent ASP.NET objects. Second, it improves the performance of calls that 
                            the page places to apartment- threaded COM objects by ensuring that the page 
                            (actually, the thread that processes the request for the page) and the COM 
                            objects it creates share an apartment. AspCompat=&quot;true&quot; forces ASP.NET request 
                            threads into single-threaded apartments (STAs). If those threads create COM 
                            objects marked ThreadingModel=Apartment, then the objects are created in the 
                            same STAs as the threads that created them. Without AspCompat=&quot;true,&quot; request 
                            threads run in a multithreaded apartment (MTA) and each call to an STA-based COM 
                            object incurs a performance hit when it&#39;s marshaled across apartment boundaries.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Do not set AspCompat to true if your page uses no COM objects or if it uses COM 
                            objects that don&#39;t access ASP intrinsic objects and that are registered 
                            ThreadingModel=Free or ThreadingModel=Both.</span></p>

                            <span>Caching is a technique widely used in computing to increase performance by 
                            keeping frequently accessed or expensive data in memory. In context of web 
                            application, caching is used to retain the pages or data across HTTP requests 
                            and reuse them without the expense of recreating them.ASP.NET has 3 kinds of

                            Each incoming HTTP request received by ASP.NET is ultimately processed by a 
                            specific instance of a class that implements IHTTPHanlder. IHttpHanlderFactory 
                            provides the infrastructure that handles the actual resolution of URL requests 
                            to IHttpHanlder instances. In addition to the default IHttpHandlerFactory 
                            classes provided by ASP.NET, developers can optionally create and register 
                            factories to support rich request resolution.</span></p>

                            ===========
                            <br />
                            DataReader is like a forward only recordset. It fetches one row at a time so 
                            very less network cost compare to DataSet(Fethces all the rows at a time). 
                            DataReader is readonly so we can&#39;t do any transaction on them. DataReader will 
                            be the best choice where we need to show the data to the user which requires no 
                            transaction. As DataReader is forward only so we can&#39;t fetch data randomly. .NET 
                            Data Providers optimizes the datareader to handle huge amount of data.

                            <br />
                            =======
                            <br />
                            DataSet is an in memory representation of a collection of Database objects 
                            including tables of a relational database schemas.
                            <br />
                            DataSet is always a bulky object that requires a lot of memory space compare to 
                            DataReader. We can say that the DataSet is a small database because it stores 
                            the schema and data in the application memory area. DataSet fetches all data 
                            from the datasource at a time to its memory area. So we can traverse through the 
                            object to get the required data like querying database.</span></p>

                        <p>
                            <span>&nbsp;ViewState allows the state of objects (serializable) to be stored in a 
                            hidden field on the page. ViewState is transported to the client and back to the 
                            server, and is not stored on the server or any other external source. ViewState 
                            is used to retain the state of server-side objects between postabacks.</span></p>
