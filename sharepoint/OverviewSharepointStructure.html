                            <b><i><span>Sites</span></i></b></p>

                        <b><span>Size</span></b>
                        <br />
                            <span>The biggest factor in choosing to go with sites is size. A single site 
                            collection cannot span multiple content databases. Microsoft recommends that a 
                            single content database should not grow beyond 200 Gigabytes. This isn’t a hard 
                            limit, and with expensive hardware (Disk sub-system performance of 0.25 IOPs per 
                            GB. 2 IIOPs per GB) you can go up 4 TB however 200GB is the best practice for 
                            optimal performance and reasonable backup procedures. That being said, it really 
                            depends on the type of site that you are designing. For an internet facing site, 
                            a single site collection can work great. However for an enterprise portal and 
                            document management system that will service thousands of users and multiple 
                            departments, multiple site collections is usually the better approach since 
                            200GB is a drop in the bucket these days.</span></p>
                        <p >
                            <b><span>Master Pages</span></b>
                            <br />
                            <span>When making the decision to do multiple site collections, there are some 
                            tradeoffs to be aware of. Without the use of custom code, a master page cannot 
                            span multiple site collections. Any highly branded site would usually have a 
                            custom Master page. Master pages are like the skin of the site and define its 
                            look and feel as well as layout. That being said, by developing a custom feature 
                            you can have a unified master page across multiple site collections however 
                            making changes to that Master page cannot be deployed from SharePoint designer. 
                            You will have to deploy it via custom code as well.</span></p>
                        <p >
                            <b><span>Security Groups</span></b>
                            <br />
                            <span>Another drawback is security groups. Site collections don’t share security 
                            groups, and if you have very granular security, there may potentially be a lot 
                            of maintenance in replicating the same groups in each site collection. If you 
                            need to have multiple site collections, one way of mitigating this is by using 
                            active directory groups inside of SharePoint groups. That way you can make the 
                            change in one place and have it reflected in each site collection as long as 
                            they all reference the same AD Group.</span></p>
                        <p >
                            <b><span>Lookup Lists</span></b>
                            <br />
                            <span>Lookup lists are another reason to use a single site collection. Site 
                            columns which use lookup lists only work in the same site collection. Though you 
                            can use the content type hub to replicate content types across site collections, 
                            lookup lists can’t be replicated.</span></p>
                        <p >
                            <b><span>Consistent Navigation</span></b>
                            <br />
                            <span>For the best user experience, global navigation (also called the top menu) 
                            should be the same across your entire portal whether you are using single or 
                            multiple site collections.&nbsp; Global navigation is limited to a single site 
                            collection, so again unless you use a custom control or code, you will be doing 
                            a lot of manual updates to keep every site collections navigation in sync.</span></p>
                        <p >
                            <b><i><span>Site Collections</span></i></b></p>
                        <p >
                            <b><span>Size</span></b>
                            <br />
                            <span>The biggest advantage of going to site collections is that your content 
                            databases will scale much better beyond the recommended limit of 200GB. What 
                            this means is that you can use multiple databases to power your portal, which 
                            also means potentially multiple database servers. This allows your SharePoint 
                            server to scale much better along the data tier with additional servers.</span></p>
                        <p >
                            <span>Also of advantage is the ability to place database servers in separate geo 
                            distributed locations to increase the performance of farms that are accessed 
                            across multiple offices around the world.</span></p>
                        <p >
                            <b><span>Security Groups</span></b>
                            <br />
                            <span>This was listed as a positive for sites, however if your requirements need 
                            certain sites to be highly secured and have very different and separate security 
                            groups (for example multiple domains) then splitting out a site as a site 
                            collection is a better choice.</span></p>
                        <p >
                            <b><span>Backup and Performance</span></b>
                            <br />
                            <span>Since using multiple site collections allows you to use multiple content 
                            databases, it also makes backing up your databases much more practical since 
                            each one will be a manageable size. Another advantage, though not as apparent, 
                            is when you go to do an update of a service pack or hotfix or even an upgrade of 
                            the whole server, this also means updating your content database. If you have a 
                            database that is terabytes in size the update could take an extremely long time 
                            which means more downtime for your users.</span></p>

                            <span>Web Application</span></h3>
                        <p >
                            <span>In the SharePoint hierarchy, a web application is the top tier.&nbsp; It 
                            is nothing but an IIS (Internet Information Services) website which is 
                            specifically configured to run as a SharePoint site and contains at least one or 
                            more site collections. While creating a web application you can either associate 
                            it with an existing application pool or you can create a new application to be 
                            associated with it. While creating your SharePoint web application you also need 
                            to specify a content database and details like authentication method used to 
                            connect to the content database.&nbsp; It is possible to have multiple content 
                            databases for different site collections for the web application. Using multiple 
                            databases makes it easier for content database management, backup, restore, 
                            etc...</span></p>

                            that uses HTTP as its core communication protocol and delivers information to 
                            the user by using Web-based languages such as HTML and XML.</span></p>

                            <span>As I mentioned above, a web application needs to have one or more site 
                            collections. A site collection is a logical container for grouping sites and 
                            allows hierarchical arrangement of sites within it. A site collection has 
                            exactly one default top level site and may have many child sites. By default all 
                            sites of a site collection share navigation, security/permissions, templates and 
                            content types so you should plan to include all sites in single site collection 
                            if they all need to share these things.&nbsp; If needed, you can specifically 
                            change settings for a particular site if required.</span></p>

                            a GUID or the URL of the top-level site for the site collection. Each site 
                            collection contains a top-level site, can contain one or more subsites, and can 
                            have a shared navigation structure.</span></p>

                            content can be Lists, Libraries (Document Library, Picture Library, Report 
                            Library, Form Library etc...) Web pages, Web parts, Sites and Workspaces.

                                that getting a site collection provisioned with have a higher admin cost than 
                                just creating a sub site. Sub site creation can be carried out by a member of 
                                the owners group of any site or site collection. Whereas site collection 
                                creation has to be completed by Farm Administrators unless there is a mechanism 
                                provided though web wizards.</span></li>
                            <li ><span>As part of a backup and recovery policy you want your 
                                data to be very quickly restored if there are any problems or if there has been 
                                content that has gotten deleted that you need to retrieve. A site collection is 
                                better in this case because you can restore the site collection more easily than 
                                you can restore a site or a sub site of a site.</span></li>

                            <span>Some of the reasons why you should select a sub site:</span></h3>

                            <li ><span>You want to inherit the same security for the new sub 
                                site as its parent site &amp; the security model for your organization already 
                                exists. You want to create a new site but you don&#39;t want to change or move away 
                                from the existing security model implemented already.</span></li>
                            <li ><span>There has been a team in your organization unit that 
                                created many new site columns and site content types that you would like to use 
                                throughout your site and its sub sites -- as parent sites can contain site 
                                content types, these can be used in all subs sites of the site hierarchy -- Site 
                                Collections break this functionality.</span></li>
                            <li ><span>You want to allow the Site Owners and Designers to 
                                manage all sites that get created without any overhead of having to log a 
                                support call for a new site collection.</span></li>
                            <li ><span>You want to aggregate data throughout your site 
                                hierarchy using Web Parts like the Content Query Web Part, Data View Web Part 
                                and other data aggregation Web Parts.</span></li>
                            <li ><span>You have a site template that you want to apply to the 
                                new site that creates a couple of lists and libraries as part of the template -- 
                                an example may be you want a Tasks Manager Site Template where a site can 
                                maintain and manage all your tasks using tasks lists and to have them integrate 
                                with Outlook.</span></li>
                            <li ><span>If your site is going to be a short lived site and it&#39;s 
                                only going to be used in the process of creating some other content. An example 
                                might be a meeting site where you create a site that is created from a Meetings 
                                Templates. You can record and schedule meetings regarding the production of a 
                                catalog of products for your organization. This site is short lived and won&#39;t be 
                                in existence after the production of the catalog is completed.</span></li>
