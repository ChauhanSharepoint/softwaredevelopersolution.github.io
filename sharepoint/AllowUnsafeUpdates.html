                            <span >In short here is how to deal with <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates</b>:</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span >1</span></b><span >) Don’t update SharePoint objects 
                            from your code behind on GET requests as if you do so your code will be 
                            exploitable via a 
                            <span >cross-site scripting</span>. If you 
                            understand the consequences of doing this and still want to do it then read 
                            below about how to use the <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates</b> property.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span >2</span></b><span >) If your code is processing a 
                            POST request then make sure you call <span>SPUtility.ValidateFormDigest() </span>
                            before you do anything else. This will ensure that the post request is validated 
                            (that it is not a cross-site scripting attack) and after that you will not have 
                            to worry about <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates</b>,<b> </b>because its default value will 
                            be “<b><i>true</i></b>” after the form digest is validated. To find out more

                        <p>
                            <span >The Microsoft idea behind introducing the <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates</b> 
                            property is to protect YOU from cross-site scripting attacks. The way 
                            this works is that if your application is running in an HTTPContext (i.e. it’s a 
                            web part for instance) and the request is a GET request then SharePoint will 
                            refuse to do any changes unless the value of <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates </b>is set to 
                            true and by default it will be false for GET requests. If you try to do any 
                            updates to lists, webs or any SharePoint objects that require an <b>SPSite</b> 
                            to be created first, and if you don’t set <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates</b> to true you 
                            will get this exception:</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <i><span >System.Exception: Microsoft.SharePoint.SPException: The 
                            security validation for this page is invalid. Click Back in your Web browser, 
                            refresh the page, and try your operation again. —&gt; 
                            System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x8102006D): The security

                        <p>
                            <span >It is important to understand that if you are writing a class 
                            library for example, your code will behave differently when called from a web 
                            application and when called from a rich client. Actually if the <b>
                            HTTPContext.Current</b> is null then <b>AllowSafeUpdates</b> will be always 
                            true. This is the case in rich clients where no cross-scripting is possible as 
                            there are simply no web requests.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <span >Usually when you create your own <b>SPSite</b> or <b>SPWeb </b>
                            objects, i.e. when you are not getting them from the <b>SPContext </b>(such as 
                            SPContext.Web), and when you try to update anything such as web or list 
                            properties, list items metadata etc, you may get the exception listed above. 
                            This is a clear indication that <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates </b>of the SPWeb is false 
                            and this is preventing you from doing the update. This problem is resolved 
                            easily by setting the <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates</b> of the parent web object to 
                            true. Still sometimes even after you have done this you may still be getting the 
                            same error. This is typically caused by one of the the following reasons:</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span >A</span></b><span >) You have set the <b>
                            AllowUnsafeUpdate </b>to true for the wrong SPWeb</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <span >You have to be careful because sometimes the <b>ParentWeb</b> of 
                            an object is not the same instance of the web you have retrieved the object 
                            from. For example when you go <b>initialWeb.Lists[listId] </b>you would expect 
                            that the returned list’s ParentWeb instance is the same as you <b>initialWeb</b>. 
                            However this is not the case. So if somewhere later in your code you go <b>
                            list.ParentWeb.UpdateSomething()</b> this will not work because you have never 
                            set the <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates</b> property of <b>list.ParentWeb</b>. You have 
                            set it for your <b>initialWeb </b>but even that this is the same web as the 
                            list’s parent web both are different instances. Usually you see the error and 
                            then you go and investigate in Reflector whether this is the same instance or 
                            not.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <span >The author suggests that you can set the <b>HttpContent.Current
                            </b>to null before you do your updates and then reassign its initial preserved 
                            value when done. This will work great but remember to set the HTTPContent to 
                            null as early as possible. In the post above probably SharePoint uses the <b>
                            site.RootWeb </b>to do the updates to the site scoped features and the RootWeb’s
                            <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates </b>hasn’t been set to true explicitly.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span >B</span></b><span >) The <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates</b> 
                            gets reset to false sometimes after you have set it to true</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <span >If we have a look at how the property is managed it turns out 
                            that it is stored in the request object associated with every SPWeb (which is 
                            actually a COM object)</span></p>

                            <span>true</span>)]</span></p>

                        <p>
                            <span >This actually means that every time the request is reset, the 
                            property will be also reset to its default value. The <b>m_Request</b> member is 
                            modified when a new web is created, when the web is disposed or when the <b>

                        <p>
                            <span >So any operation that calls <b>SPWeb.Invalidate()</b> will reset
                            <b>AllowUnsafeUpdate </b>to its default value. And for code running under 
                            HTTPContext, i.e. web applications, this default value for a GET request will be 
                            false. I’ve looked up for you all legitimate cases for which Invalidate() is 
                            being called by the SharePoint object model. These cases are:</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span >1</span></b><span >) When the <b>Name</b> or the <b>
                            ServerRelativeUrl</b> properties of the <b>SPWeb</b> are changed and then <b>
                            Update()</b> is called. In this case the AllowUnsafeUpdate is reset because with 
                            the change of these properties the URL of the web will change and logically the 
                            request object will change as it will now point to a different URL.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span >2</span></b><span >) When any object that implements
                            <b>ISecurable </b>(those are SPWeb, SPList and SPListItem) breaks or reverts 
                            their role definition inheritance. This means every time you call <b>
                            SPRoleDefinitionCollection.BreakInheritance()</b>, <b>BreakRoleInheritance()</b>,
                            <b>ResetRoleInheritance()</b> or set the value of <b>HasUniquePerm</b> the <b>
                            AllowUnsafeUpdates</b> property of the parent web will reset to its default 
                            value and you may need to set it back to true in order to do further updates to 
                            the same objects.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <b><span >3</span></b><span >) In many cases when an exception 
                            is caught by the SharePoint object model when you try to retrieve any sort of 
                            data the <b>AllowUnsafeUpdates </b>of the parent web will be reset to false as a 
                            precaution to protect against potential exploits. In those cases however the 
                            objects will be in unknown state anyway after the request has been reset and the 
                            exception is re-thrown so they are of no practical interest.</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <span >And finally it is also good to mention that you may get another 
                            related exception when trying to update your SharePoint objects and that is:</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <i><span >System.Exception: Microsoft.SharePoint.SPException: Cannot

                        <p>
                            <span >This usually happens when some updates have been made to an

                            simply need to create fresh copies of the SPSite and the SPWeb objects and do 
                            the updates on the objects retrieved from the fresh copies. And of course don’t
