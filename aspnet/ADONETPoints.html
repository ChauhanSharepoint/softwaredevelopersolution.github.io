                            second parameter specifies the name of the DataTable in the DataSet which will 
                            contain the data.</span></p>

                            <br />
                            ADO.NET works on DataSet that can represent a whole database or even a data 
                            table as a disconnected object and thereby eliminates the problem of the 
                            constraints of number of databases being connected. In this way scalability is 
                            achieved.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>2&gt;Data Source Independence:-</b>
                            <br />
                            In ADO.NET DataSet is completely independent of data source and no way DataSet 
                            is controlled by the data source as it happens in case of RecordSet.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>3&gt;Interoperability:-</b>
                            <br />
                            As ADO.NET transmits the data using the format of XML which is not dependent on 
                            ADO.NET or windows platform.
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            It supports strongly typed fields by using CTS.
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            The performance in ADO.NET is higher in comparison to ADO that uses COM 
                            marshalling.
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            As in ADO.NET transmission is via XML format, therefore it can pass through 
                            firewalls.</span></p>

                            <span>The .NET DataProvider is a set of components that includes the Connection, 
                            Command, DataReader and DataAdapter objects. It is used for connecting to a 
                            database , executing commands and retrieving results. Using the .NET data 
                            provider we can either access database directly or use the disconnected 
                            approach. For the disconnected approach we use DataSet class.

                            can be any database file. The connection object contains information like the 
                            provider name, server name, datasource name, user name and password.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Command Object:-</b> It is used for connect the connection object to a 
                            DataReader or DataAdapter object. The command object allow us to execute SQL 
                            statement or a stored procedure in a data source.
                            <br />

                            <b>DataReader Object:-</b> It is used to read the data in a fast and efficient 
                            manner from the database. It is generally used to extract one or a few records 
                            or specific field values or to execute simple SQL statement.
                            <br />

                            <b>DataAdapter Object:-</b> It is used to fill data from the database into the 
                            DataSet object. it is use din the disconnected approach.</span></p>

                            differences between ADO and ADO.NET?</span></u></b></p>
                       
                        <p>
                            <b><span>ADO relied on a connection based model</span></b><span> . In the 
                            connected approach, the client had to be connected with the server and remain 
                            connected till the whole procedure or transaction was completed. Time resources 
                            and bandwidth became major constraints on such architecture.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            To solve this problem the latter version of ADO used RecordSet. All the contents 
                            from the data source were copied into RecordSet. This allows clients to get 
                            disconnected from the server, work on the RecordSet and copy the changes back to 
                            the data source again. This approach did not succeed much because it requires 
                            COM marshalling to transmit disconnected data, it support only those datatypes 
                            that were defined by the COM standards and hence required type conversion.
